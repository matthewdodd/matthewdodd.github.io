                  </hi>. I am clerk of the works at Hampton Court. On Friday week last, the 14th of October, the men were at work in Mrs. Sheridan's apartments—about three o'clock, I saw the kitchen window was open, the workmen being inside, cleaning the place—the footpath was swept up that afternoon—it is not a thoroughfare—there is about ten feet between the footpath and the house—I saw it the next morning, about half-past nine o'clock, the 15th, when it was quite clean, and had been raked over—I saw a man and a woman's footmarks—I received information, and went to the kitchen of Mrs. Sheridan's apartments—the window was open, and one square of glass was broken—it was whole the day before—I found the parlour door had been broken open, and the plate cupboard also—it appeared to have been opened by some instrument about a quarter of an inch wide—in the footmarks there were six nails in the ball of the man's foot—I counted the nails in the impression on the ground—I did not compare any shoe—all I did was to count the nails in the right shoe of Henry Grover—I saw the nails there on the first examination, but at the second examination they were out—to the best of my belief it was the same shoe.</p>

On the Monday morning I went to Mr. Hawgood, a pawnbroker, in the Old Kent-road, and discovered this plate.</p>

About nine o'clock that morning Martha Grover came to know if I would let her have a cart, or horse and chaise, to take her and her sister and husband to Vauxhall, as she had just received a letter that her mother was dying—she did not care what she paid—I said, "No, I have not one; Arnold's coach will be by in a short time, you had better go by that"—at the same time Goatley asked if they could have one—there was a man at the door, but I did not see his face.</p>

I am a stage-coach driver from Kingston to London, At half-past eight o'clock on Saturday morning I saw Martha Grover and Goatley—Goatley had a box similar to this, and Grover a bundle in a shawl similar to this—they called to me to stop—I pulled up to take some man up, dressed in a fustian jacket—I did not see his face—when I got on about a quarter of a mile the man was gone—I took Grover and Goatley to town.</p>

I went and asked her to come over; she said, "What have you been doing?" I said, "Nothing; this plate belongs to Lady Duffern, and we are going to pawn it." She said, "Goatley lives with her;" I said, "No, with Mrs. Sheridan;" we then went and pawned the teapot; we decided what we should say before we went in. I said I was the confidential servant, and Goatley was the daughter. I wanted as much as I could, as the lady's husband was travelling; he lent the money, and it was tied up with the tickets. I put it in Goatley's hand; we took a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and she went home; when I saw her again she said she had thrown the money away. I am guilty of taking the plate with her, but not of stealing it.</p>

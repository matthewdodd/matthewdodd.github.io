               <p>GEORGE GRAVES. I am an officer - I remember the prisoner being examined on Tuesday last - when I took him to the lock-up room he said, "The whole truth shall come out, I will show up the real thieves" - I had not promised or threatened him - he began to tell me something - I said,"You had better say nothing to me, but write it down, I will call for it;" I called and got this letter from him.</p>
               <p>MR. FULLWOOD. This is his writing, and this is our annatto.(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>"Newgate, Jan. 1, 1834.</p>
               <p>"I have known the witness, Joseph Howe, about eight months ago. I met him in August last in Crab-tree-row; he asked me where I was going? I told him nowhere particular; he asked me what was the matter with my hands; I told him it was my work; he asked me what work it was; I told him; he asked me if I could get any of the stuff? I told him I never had; I told him I did not like; he said he could put it away; I said I would get some; on the Friday I took him about 24 pounds, he sold on the Saturday; he had four half-crowns; he gave me two of them; we went to the Adam and Eve together; the next week I took him about 180 pounds to the end of Hare-alley; he carried it to his mother's house; I waited for his coming back again to me. On the Friday night following he told me it was sold for sixpence-halfpenny per pound; he said his mother was going with it along with Vanheason; he said it was sold in Wheeler-street; I asked him if he knew their names; he said, No. About half-past eight o'clock I went to Mrs. Howe's house; she told me it was right; she showed me a bill; I did not know the handwriting; it was wrote very bad; she told me that she had given Vanheason five shillings and the porter a shilling, and they had sixpennyworth of gin; we had some conversation with her; I then left her house and went to the Adam and Eve to meet him; he was there; he called me on one side and told me it was all right; he gave me two sovereigns and eight shillings; he said he had the same; he showed me the same quantity of money that he gave me; he said he should buy a suit of clothes with his money; I met him on the Saturday; I met witness in Church-street; he had on new clothes; I said to him, You have turned a Gentleman all at once; he said, When shall you get any more? I told him in a few days. The next week I took some to his mother's house - it was to fetch 4l. 8s. 6d.; it was at his house about four days; I asked him if it was sold? he said he had not got an answer about it yet. On the Friday night his mother came to the Adam and Eve; she said to her son Joseph, 'Have you taken the stuff?' he said 'No:' she said, 'Some one has stole it then;' she called me on one side and said, 'Bill, some one has stole the stuff out of my house; I know it is Vanheason is the thief.' I said, 'That is a very pretty thing for me;' he said, 'I followed him with a load all down Bermondsey; I lost him there: I know it was him.' I have been in her sons' company many times since; this is the whole truth; what they say is false. As for knowing anything of the other prisoner, or anything of any cake annatto, I never sold any in my life.</p>
               <p>"I hope Mr. Fullwood will come or send to me to-morrow, and let me know, as I want to make my defence, and to know if he intends to prosecute the witness. Do not forget it, if you please."I remain yours,</p>

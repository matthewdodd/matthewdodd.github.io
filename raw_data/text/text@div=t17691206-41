He did himself, but we found him, and brought him out to the constable; then I asked him how he came by these things; he said he bought them at an old iron shop. I asked him where was my oyl stone? and said he had better deliver it up than give us so much trouble. Then he went and delivered up all the other things except the plough.</p>

               <p>Willson. The first time we did promise him to let him go if he would tell us, and let us have them. He would not then. But we made him no promise the last time. He had pawned the plough to pay for being married; he went with us to the pawnbroker where we found it; he delivered up the other things. ( Mentioning them and the respective owners.) He acknowledged he took them, and begged for mercy. ( The tools produced and deposed to by the respective owners.)</p>

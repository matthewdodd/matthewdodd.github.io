                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker and jeweller, and live in Welington-street, Woolwich. On the 12th of January, I placed some watches and other property in my window at nine o'clock in the morning—I had occasion to go to London about eleven o'clock, and saw them safe in the window about five minutes before eleven o'clock—I returned at five o'clock, and then missed them—there was a pane of glass in the window partly cocked, hut not broken through—I found it quite broken through when I came home, and the piece forced out laying inside the window—the watches were worth 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have since seen two of them.</p>

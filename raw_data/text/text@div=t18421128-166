                  </hi>. I keep the Barclay Arms, at Cranford. On the morning of the 29th of Nov., about half-past eight o'clock, a coach-load of people and a van-full came to my house, they went into my kitchen, and pulled all the things about there, and others of them went up stairs—I called the servant, but those who were in the kitchen would not let her out, while others were plundering the larder—the prisoner was one who was there—there was a piece of beef, a cooked hare, (almost a whole one,) and three quartern loaves, taken out of the house—they paid for the liquor which they drank, but not for what they took out of the cupboard—they did not ask for the beef or the hare, which I missed—this is the beef—it is mine.</p>

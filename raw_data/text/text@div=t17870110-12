               <p>What sort of a shop was it? - Upon my word I can hardly tell you; it was a shop of every thing, rags, old iron, old shoes, &amp;c. I went back with the constable, and found three pair more, which were nine pair; I found two pair of children's shoes; they were crammed into the window, so that I did not see them before; Davis was there; he went away to get a constable for me for robbing the house as he called it, and I saw no more him, till I saw him the next day before the Justice;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100026"></xptr>I staid there some considerable time, two hours for ought I know; a servant of Davis's took the shoes away by the constable's order; I do not know who she was.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they are the same shoes that you saw in the shop? - Yes, I am confident they are; there is my own handwriting on them, which was before the shoes were made; my hand-writing was in a part of the shoe, which was visible to any body; there is a pair of shoes of the name of Robinson; we always write the name of every gentleman's bespoke shoes, and I know the others by different marks; I am quite confident of it.</p>
               <p>Did Ford say what you and he were come about? - Ford told me where the shoes were; he said nothing about the price of them before Davis.</p>
               <p>What are these shoes worth a pair? - They are different shoes, of different value, I really cannot pretend to say the value of them; those that I marked Robinson, we should have sold for seven shillings as bespoke work.</p>
               <p>What would the others have sold for? - I look upon it my master gave fifty or fifty-three shillings a dozen for them, that is about four shillings and sixpence a pair.</p>
               <p>What did Ford say he sold them for? - Some he said he sold for two shillings a pair, some for half a crown, some for three shillings; he made a variation of the prizes all the way through.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Davis's Counsel. Mr. Lowry keeps a very large retail shop? - Yes, he does.</p>
               <p>All bespoke work in this town is marked very much in the same way? - Very often.</p>

               <p>When it is not bespoke work, I believe it is usual to write the name of the man to whom the work is delivered out? - No, we do not.</p>
               <p>When you went to this man's shop, you pitched upon several articles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They were hanging up publicly in the shop? - They were hanging upon nails, and two pair under some rags in the window.</p>
               <p>You do not mean to say they were concealed there? - They were under some covering in the window, whether they were concealed or not, it is unknown to me.</p>

               <p>Was the window a front window, or a back window? - It was a front window.</p>
               <p>Was there writing in the other shoes as well as those of Mr. Robinson's? - No, there are different marks, numbers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Are these town made shoes? - Some are, and some are country.</p>
               <p>Now were any of the marks you found in the shoes disguised or altered at all? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Look now, and tell me if they are altered? - Not that I directly see.</p>
               <p>Then look at them and tell us? - I do not see that they are.</p>
               <p>If they had been walked upon for an hour; or rubbed in the kennel, you would not have known them? - No, I do not know that I should.</p>
               <p>If the name had been struck through, you would not have known them? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know how long it is since these shoes, particularly Mr. Robinson's, were lost? - That is impossible to say.</p>
               <p>Is it within five, six, or seven months? I will answer for it, it is within seven months.</p>
               <p>You took the woman to the watch-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Davis was at large? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know how he came there? - No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Davis acknowledged to buying all the shoes before the Magistrate, when the Magistrate committed him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Tell us all that he said about it? - I do not know any thing particular.</p>
               <p>Why did not he say that he had no idea they were stolen? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Did not he say that he gave a fair price for them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100027"></xptr>Did not you keep a public house, and serve the office of a thief-taker? - I kept a public house, I never was a thief-taker, I was a constable; I marked them at the bottom with figures: when Davis said he bought them at a fair price, I told him that the man that sold them to him, brought them on the Sunday afternoon, and they were not finished.</p>
               <p>Did not he say that the man said he would sell them for the leather, and give him the price? you did not lose all these things at a time? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you had known Davis before? - Yes, I knew him when he lived in Eagle-street, years ago; he is a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>Did he say what he gave for these shoes? - He said for some of them he gave four shillings and sixpence a pair, and the man contradicted him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Suppose I was a distressed shoe-maker, I must sell my shoes; it is as much as they are worth, if a man was to make a present of his labour? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to say you do not recollect that he said I am distressed for money, I will let you have them for the value of the leather? - I do not remember that they did say so; they sent for me down, and a woman said if five guineas was an object, it should not be wanted; I said I would prosecute.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Ford. I took eight pair, and some I got half a crown a pair for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Davis. Please to ask him who he sold them to, for he never sold them to me.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner Ford. Who did you sell them to? - I sold them to that man.</p>
               <p>Davis. He never sold them to me except two pair for four shillings and sixpence, and another pair for three shillings and sixpence; my wife had been deceased about sixteen weeks, during the greatest part of that time before her death, I was out of the way of my business, and she conducted it; she died suddenly, and it worked so much on my spirits, that I was out of the way; and other people used to buy and sell, for I could hardly bear the place; I lost a worthy woman, and when I lost her, I lost all: I acknowledge I bought two pair of him; he told me they were his own property; he said he worked for his own customers, and sometimes he made up shoes for the shops; he said he was to have seven shillings for them; I told him I sold second hand, as well as new, so that we must buy them as reasonable as we could, not to under-value them; the first I bought of him was that pair at four shillings and sixpence, and I looked upon them as his own property; I questioned him many times over, and was loth to buy; he desired only the money that the stuff cost, because he was in necessity.</p>

               <p>I was housekeeper to the prisoner Davis; I lived with him three months; since his wife died, I conducted the business in a good measure; I recollect at first of my coming to Mr. Davis, a man came in with a pair of of shoes to sell; Mr. Davis asked him if they were his, and he said they were, he made them; he asked him, are you a craft? he said yes; then he asked him what he asked for them, he told him seven shillings; he said he could not think of giving him so much; he said he was to have seven shillings if they had fitted, as they misfitted, he must sell them for what he could now, as he was very much distressed; Mr. Davis says, well what is the lowest you can think of taking, for I cannot think of giving you that, I have very little call for such things; he said you must give me what you can afford; Mr. Davis asked me for one shilling, and I gave him one shilling and sixpence; then Davis took four shillings and sixpence, and laid it upon the counter; the man took the money, and laid down the shoes; Mr. Davis hung them upon a nail, and said, there, God knows when I shall get my money for them; they were publicly shewn, they were never covered to my knowledge; there was no disguise or concealment; when Mr. Sanders; and the other came, I was up stairs; they took me to the watch-house; my master went to see for a constable, and some time after he came to me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>During three months that you have known him, has he been a fair dealing honest man, or has he been a receiver of stolen goods? - Sir, I have known him three years; my child has been apprentice to him three years; he was more like a father than a master, and his deceased wife was like a mother.</p>
               <p>Court. How came the other shoes into the shop? - I do not know Sir; there was a niece of his was with him for a time; she laid out his money.</p>
               <p>Do you know her name? - Yes,

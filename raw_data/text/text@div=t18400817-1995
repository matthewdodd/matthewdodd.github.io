                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Inland department, in the General Post-office, London; the prisoner was a clerk in the same office. On the morning of the 4th of August I and the prisoner were in the same office, separating the town and country and foreign letters, which had arrived that morning—about five minutes after six o'clock, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner take a small letter in his hand—I happened to look towards him, whether he saw me I cannot tell, but he threw it under the foreign box, which is raised about six inches above the table—there was only one row of letters before him then—one of the men then laid two more rows before him, and then he pushed those letters towards the foreign box, which con<lb></lb>cealed the small letter from my view—he threw a larger one over the small one—he pushed the three rows of letters towards the two letters I have mentioned, having put the large letter over the small one—there is five or six inches between the box and the surface of the table—about twenty minutes after seven o'clock I saw him put his hand under the foreign box, by the side of the three rows of letters, and after fumbling about, he withdrew his hand closed, and appeared to convey something into his pocket—he left the table directly, left that part of the office, and went into another part of his division—I then removed the three rows of letters which I have mentioned, and found the large letter, but the small letter was gone—I reported it to Mr. Holgate, the President of the Inland Office—this is the letter, to the best of my opinion—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I did not see the address, but it was a letter of this size.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's sister; I live with my parents, in Portland-place, New North-road, Islington; my father is a retired officer in the army, and has lost his right leg. I remember Monday night, the 3rd of August—my brother had been in difficulties about a debt which he had contracted with a tailor—he generally came home between nine and ten o'clock at night—he went out in the morning from a quarter to twenty minutes after five—on Monday evening, the 3rd, I went with my mother into my brother's bed-room to place three sovereigns on the mantel-piece for him—we placed them there—my brother slept at home that night—I always make my brother's bed—I made it on Tuesday morning—I was not up before he left in the morning, but I was the first who went into his room—the sovereigns were gone then.</p>

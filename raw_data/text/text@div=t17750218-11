               <p>Q. to Simons. Could not this man when he was in the shop, have got into the house, if he had been so minded.</p>
               <p>Simons. Yes, he could.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence:</p>
               <p>I cannot say a great deal, I did not break open the house; where I found the anvil, there was no place but the sky, no ceiling. I think it is very hard that two poor men should have been taken up for this affair, who are quite innocent.</p>

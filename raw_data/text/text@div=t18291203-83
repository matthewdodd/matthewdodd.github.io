On the 26th of October, about nine o'clock I fell in with a girl of the town. whose name was Flora, - she took me to a lodging-house, No. 5, Laurence-street, St. Giles'; we went up stairs, and I went to bed - I put my watch-guard and pin into my hat before I went to bed; I was merry, but knew what I was about - I awoke in the morning, about half-past seven o'clock; Flora was gone, and my watch-guard, pin, and great-coat - I went down stairs, and met a young woman, named Cracknell; I saw the prisoner standing opposite the house - I went and asked him the name of the person who kept the house; he said Grant -I described to him all the circumstances of the robbery; he said, "The property is gone now, you will never see it any more," and that these things often occured in that house - I went in the afternoon to make further inquiries, and saw the prisoner near the same house again; he passed by me.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Laurence-street, next door to this house. On the Tuesday the prisoner came to my room, and shewed a watch to Porter, who I live with - it had no guard on it at that time; he asked what we thought it was worth - I had seen Flora; the prisoner lives with Ann Norey, who is partner with Flora- the prisoner said Flora had committed a robbery, and shewed the watch; this was between eight and nine o'clock on the Tuesday morning - I saw him again at four in the afternoon, with the same watch in his possession.</p>

I live with Sidney as a husband - what she has stated is correct; the prisoner brought up a watch, and asked what I thought it was worth - I did not understand from him who had committed the robbery; I heard it in the course of the day - he said that Flora Norey had knocked him up at two o'clock in the morning, and left the watch in his care.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was with my brother officer in Canonbury fields; we went to relieve two other officers, and as we stood talking together, I saw the prisoner laying on his belly by the prosecutor - knowing the prisoner, I watched and saw him get up and leave, and just as he got by us, he threw away a stick, which belonged to the prosecutor, and ran up the field - I ran and asked the prosecutor if he knew the man who had been laying by his side - he said nobody had been by his side; his trousers were undone - he felt and missed his watch; I ran after the prisoner: my brother officer ran one way and I the other, and in the Lower-road I met him in custody.</p>

I recollect the two men coming to my house on a Sunday morning; after I served them the prosecutor used bad language, which I told him not to do, or I should call the Police - the prisoner said, "Leave him to me, Mr. Hayward, I will take care of him;" the prosecutor paid 6d. for what was drank, and the prisoner took him away - they were about ten minutes in my house.</p>

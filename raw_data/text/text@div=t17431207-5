My Man suspected the Prisoner, because he went often into the Yard, and advised me to secrete myself upon the Stairs; he came in about five or six Days, I went upon the Cellar Stairs and secreted myself; and when he thought the Way was clear he unlocked the Cupboard Door, took out a Mug, put it into the Breast of his Coat, and carried it backward, and threw it into a Hole; when he came in I perceived he had nothing about him: Some Time after I thought he was going to fetch the Mug, or to knock it to Pieces, I took a Candle, and found it in a Hole covered over; said I, are you not a Villain to rob me; so he asked me what Damage I had sustained by him, and he would give me a Note for the Money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174312070005"></xptr> - I told him I would be as favourable as I could.</p>

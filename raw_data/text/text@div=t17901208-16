I cannot positively say, whether it was the prisoner or not, but he was in different cloathing to what he was the next day; he brought it in the evening; I do not perfectly know the day; I took no notice of the time; I am clear it was not half past six, if it was six; I told him it was only fit for old iron, he said it was his, and he was obliged to make a fire without it: was found in the front of my shop, the porter said how long have you bought this grate, says I, how long have you lost it? says he, a fortnight; then says I, it cannot be this, because I bought it last night; then says he, by God, it is the very thing I want.</p>
               <p>What do you deal in? - Old iron and cloaths, and second hand things; I suppose if I had said the grate had been stolen for a month the man would have owned it.</p>

I was coming from Haughton-street, Clare-market, on the 9th of August, about four o'clock in the morning - I had been up about half an hour, and was going to Turnmill-street to work. I met the two prisoners in Fox<placeName id="t18250915-39-crimeloc211">-court, Gray's Inn-lane</placeName>

I believe Collins addressed me first, in a great many flattering words, and then each of them took hold of my arms - they kept hold of me till they had cut away my pocket with 16 s. in it - they took my gloves, snuff box and handkerchief. I cried for the watchman, but they got away; as soon as I got out of the court, I found a patrol, and went with him and the watchman; we found them in Fetter-lane, Holborn. 5 s. 6 d. was found on Collins, and a pen knife and 2 1/2 d. on Brown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you lose this 16 s.? A. In Fox-court, Gray's Inn-lane. I had slept the night before in Haughton-street. I had not been drunk. I had only had a little porter - they were found about twenty minutes after, but none of the property was found on them. I knew them by having seen them many times before in Holborn of an evening.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it the nearest way to Turnmill-street, to go through Gray's Inn-lane? A. I do not know - there are seven houses of ill fame in Fox-court.</p>

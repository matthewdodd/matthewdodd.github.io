                  </hi>. I live in York-square, Commercial-road. On the 5th of July I went into my back yard, about half-past five o'clock I missed a bullock's tongue, and these doves, which I had seen safe about ten o'clock the night before—I informed the policeman, and we traced some feathers to Three Compass-court, Brook-street, Ratcliff, to the house of the prisoner Symonds, which is a quarter of mile from my house—the policeman asked if any boys had been there; or if any body had brought any doves—Symonds said "No"—the policeman went up stairs—I staid below, and found, in an iron pot on the fire, the tongue which I had lost—Symonds</p>

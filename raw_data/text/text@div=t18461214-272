                  </hi>. I am a groom. On Thursday night, the 3rd of Dec, I lodged at Mr. Hickman's, the King's Head, High-row, Knightsbridge—i went to bed about eleven o'clock—there had been a concert in the house, which was not over then—I got up about twenty minutes before five o'clock—when I came down I had a candle in my hand—I found the bar-door was broken open—I saw a dark lantern on a little shelf just inside the bar-door, and just outside the bar-door, in the passage, I saw a shawl full of cigars, tied up, and a woman's cloak on the top of it, and on that <hi rend="italic">a jemmy</hi>, or crow-bar—I looked inside the bar door and saw the drawers were opened, and some of them on the floor—! just looked round the door into the bar parlour adjoining the bar, and saw the shadow of a man just turning round—I was not quick enough to see his person—he was in the bar parlour—I went and looked at the front door—that was quite safe, and the back door also—I went to the bottom of the stain and gave an alarm to Mr. Hickman—I hallooed to him, and the person in the parlour said, "Hold your tongue, or else I will <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> you"—I went up stairs, met Hickman coming from his bed-room door in his night-clothes, and we came down together—by that time the man was gone—he must have gone out at the bar<lb></lb>parlour window, which I found <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> up, and a work-box put under it, to prevent its coming down—he could then go out and go over the wall—there was no other way he could have got out—I let in the police, I unlocked the front door, and unbolted the back door—when the police came I went to my work.</p>

                  </hi> I am a corporal in the 6th Enniskillen Guards. On this night I lodged at Mr. Hickman's—I was awoke between four and five o'clock hearing a noise in the back yard—I opened my window, looked out, and heard the voices of some men in the yard—I recognized the police by their lanterns—I saw a man going over the tiles opposite to my room-window—I called out "Police!"—the man had got into another yard—the policemen were in Hickman's yard or the next—I called sufficiently loud for the man to hear me—I said, "There is a man who has got over the tiles, and jumped down to the next lane"—on my saying so, the man, before he jumped over the wall said, You b—, I well shoot you"—the top of the wall has glass bottles on it—I heard the sound of a man dropping, after he climbed the wall—the wall is five or six feet—he was ten or eleven feet from my window—it was too dark for me to distinguish the person—after Scully was taken into custody I attended at the police-court and gave evidence—I heard him cross-examine the witnesses—my attention was called to his voice—to the best of my opinion, it was the same voice that spoke to me that morn<lb></lb>ing, the voice of the man who jumped from the wall—it was a peculiar voice, and when I heard him cross-examine the witnesses it immediately attracted my attention.</p>

                  </hi> I am landlord of the King's-Head, High-row, Knights-ridge. On Friday morning, between four and five o'clock, I was alarmed—I at up, came to my room door, and found Oram there—M Garry slept up two airs of stairs, at the top of the house—I went down to the bar, and found the door broken open, the till drawn out, and a drawer in the bar drawn out—one till was broken open—I had left a child's money-box in one of the tills, con<lb></lb>taining between 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should say nine or ten parts of it were six-pences—above a hundred sixpences—that box was broken open, and the silver all gone—there was also a quantity of farthings, halfpence, and half-<hi rend="smallCaps">CROWNS</hi>, and silver table-spoons, sugar-tongs, salt-spoons, mustard-spoons, two sauce-ladles, worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, gone from the bar—the table-spoons and sugar-tongs have been found—I missed my great coat, lich was found by the police—the back and front door were secured as I left them over night—the bar parlour window was open—I had a large shawl handkerchief, which was found in the passage, full of cheroots and cigars, tied up in a bundle, about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—it was lying in the passage out<lb></lb>side the bar, ready to be taken away—the bar parlour window leads to the hack yard—it was secured by a shutter outside, with a bolt fastening down into the cellar-window—that was open when I came down, and anybody could get out at the back of the house into the yard—it was an outer shutter which fastens inside, and which could be opened by opening the window—they could then get into the yard—there is a wall in the yard—there was a shutter standing up against the wall, and I suppose the person must have got up, from the shutter on to the wall—it was the window-shutter which had been taken down and placed against the wall, which had glass bottles on the top of it—there was no appearance of violence used <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the outside of the house—I was present when the policemen took Scully into custody at Union-court, Orchard-street, between twelve and one o'clock on Saturday night, or the Sunday morning following—I said, loud enough for him to hear, "If there is any money found on him, the money I lost is new coin, of Victoria, and chiefly sixpences"—I saw the policeman search Scully, and produce from his pocket forty or fifty sixpences, all of Victoria's reign—I also missed about 1lb. of tea—there was a clasp-knife found in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> my house.</p>

On 5th Dec., about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, Potter was given in my custody by Mr. Hick<lb></lb>man, at Mr. Hickman's house—I afterwards went to 9, Union-court, Or<lb></lb>chard-street, Westminster, with Hickman and the boy Hodgson—we found a female there, and after some conversation with her, went into the front room and found Scully—I asked him if he was the owner of the house—he said "Yes"—while I was questioning him, Hodgson pointed to him, and whispered "That is him"—I took him into custody—I did not know him at the time—I searched him and found forty-five sixpences, all Victoria except one, eleven shillings, a sovereign, and a duplicate—before I found them, Hickman said, in Scully's presence, what description of money he had lost—I desired Scully to show me his hands—I found both hands very much cut in the hollow part, the wrists and fingers—it appeared to have been done very recently—the wrist had a larger cut with a piece of rag round it, and there was blood on the wristband of his shirt—I took him to the station—I had examined the state of the mortar on Mr. Hickman's wall—there was glass on both walls, and on the wall of Hickman's back yard, separating it from the next yard—I found a quantity of blood, and could trace that the thief had got on the tiles from that wall—I mean I traced blood from that wall over three or four yards into the Sun public-house yard—I did not trace it on the tiles—at the bottom of the yard of the Sun public-house I found the clasp knife which has been produced, and two silver tablespoons close to it, with blood on them—I found a coat close to the spoons, and about ten shillings' worth of copper money in the pocket—I found these at ten minutes to five o'clock, on the Fri<lb></lb>day morning—I have produced the lantern, life-preserver, and crowbar—they were given to me by Mr. Hickman—I searched Potter's lodging, No. 7, Fulham-bridge-yard, Brompton—I was informed that it was his lodging by a person who is not here, but Potter acknowledged that he lodged there—I found there two pair of new trowsers, two new waist coasts, two scarfs, two hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs, one pair of braces, and two caps, all new, and about three-quarters of a pound of mixed black and green tea—I found tea of a similar appearance scattered about Mr. Hickman's yard—I did not say anything to Scully about his bands being cut; but he said, addressing himself to Mr. Hickman, "I was drunk, and fell down near your house at Knightsbridge"—about a quarter or half an hour after he said he fell down on Constitution-bill—that is half a mile from Mr. Hickman's—he said the money was given to him by his brother Thomas, at Clerkenwell, on the Wednesday before—I said to Potter, at the station, "I have searched your lodging, 7, Fulham-bridge-yard" and I mentioned the articles I found—he said, "What of that, they are my own property"—I told him I found the tea, and mentioned all the articles—he said they were all his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the Police-force in this district. I was called to examine the hands of Scully—he told me he had had a little drop too much of drink, and fell down on some gravel on Constitution-hill—I found his hands wounded and lacerated, I have no doubt with glass—it must have arisen from being cut with glass, and could not be from the reason he assigned—the wounds were in an upward direction, towards the fingers, in a transverse direction—in the insides the fingers were lacerated as well, in a longitudinal direction, as if they had come in contact with the glass—there was a large transverse wound on the wrist, wounds in the hollow part of the hand, and on the sides of the fingers, but no wounds whatever on the prominent parts of the hand, which would be likely to come in contact with gravel, if he had fallen on it—the left wristband of his shirt was saturated with blood—they were exactly such wounds as could be accounted for by a person endeavouring to get over a wall with glass on the top of it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 41.) Last Monday week, the 7th of Dec, before the prisoners were brought before the Magistrate, I was at the Rochester-row station, in the passage of the cells—the prisoners were there, and a woman named Susan Watts, and Thomas Scully—in consequence of directions from my superior officer I listened at the cells, and heard a con<lb></lb>versation which was began by the prisoner John Scully—I reduced what I had heard to writing on the same afternoon—this is what I wrote—(<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>)</p>
               <p>"About nine o'clock on Monday morning last I was in the passage of the cells, to listen to any conversation that might take place between the prisoner. 1 had not been there many minutes, when the prisoner John Scully called out, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, I am sorry I sent Susan to your place: I did not think they</p>

John Scully said, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, I wish 1 could get to you only to say one word, everything would be as straight as a <hi rend="italic">die.'</hi> John Scully then said, '<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, they want to bring us in for a job done on the 21st of November;' when <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> answered, 'I shan't know anything about it.' John Scully said, 'What shall you say about it?' when <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> answered, 'That I am innocent; if I don't know anything, I can't say anything.' Charles Potter then said, 'And I am innocent; if I don't know anything, I can't say anything.'

John Scully then said, What are you a-going to say <hi rend="italic">V</hi> when <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> answered, That I bought them of a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>, and gave the value of them.' <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> then called, '<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, did they find anything at your place?' when <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> said, 'Yes, some knives and forks; I shall say I had them from you.' When <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> answered, 'Yes.' <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> then said that the publican wanted to say they were his; when <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> said, 'Has he got any mark on them that be will know them by <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> said he did not know. John Scully then said, 'If we get off, I suppose I shall get my 3<hi rend="italic">;.</hi> 155. back. If they should ask me how 1 came by so much money, what would you say? I don't think I shall say anything until next time we come up. I think I can get some one to come up then, and say they gave it to me.' <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> answered, 'I could get somebody.' Charles Potter then said, 'We shall go to the Sessions.' John Scully said he did not think so, at least he did not think he should, as he had two witnesses to prove that he was in bed by one o'clock. John Scully then called Susan, and said, 'You slept with me that night; I left you at the King's Head, at a quarter before one; and when you came home, you found me lying on the bed, with my hands all over dirt, and that they had been bleeding, but they were not bleeding then, and that I was drank.'

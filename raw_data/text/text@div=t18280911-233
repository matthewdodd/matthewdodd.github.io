            . I met the two prisoner at a quarterpast four o'clock in the morning, coming from Highburygrove, with these two flats - each of them had one; I asked what they were - they said rabbits, which they had bought at Finchley; they said they lived at home with their father - he did not like the rabbits, and they were going to take them to Newgate-market to sell, as they were a nuisance in the house; I took them to the watch-house, and in going to the office in the morning one of them said, "Master, I am sorry we did not tell you the truth - we did not breed the rabbits, we bought them, and we live in Long-lane, Smithfield; we could not make up 10s., and the man let us have them for what we had got;" I said I should ask them nothing, and they said no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did James claim them as his property? A. It was James who first spoke to me; Thomas never spoke to me: I have heard that they are not related to each other; I believe the proper name of James is Hitchman, but they said they were son's of the same father, and gave their names as James and Thomas Williams.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a servant at Mr. Gadsby's, Punch's tavern, in Fleet-street. I quitted the service on 26th July—my master said I should take my luggage when he paid me—I went outside the door, towards the corner of Farringdon-street, and saw a little deformed man, outside the door—it was the prisoner—I asked him if he could recommend me to a respect<lb></lb>able lodging—he told me he could take me to one—I told him to go and call a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; he did so—I went into the house and got my wages, and my box—my wages were 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I had a few halfpence in my pocket—my master's porter carried my box to the corner of Farringdon-street—the prisoner helped the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man put it on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I told the caiman to draw up to the first public-house, and I would give him a drop of ale—he did so, and I told the prisoner to call for some ale—he said, "I have no money"—I said, "I don't</p>

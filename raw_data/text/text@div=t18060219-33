             sworn. Examined by Mr. Walford. I am a constable; on the morning of the 20th of August, about ten in the morning, I was in Broad-street; I saw the prisoner going down Austin Friars, I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he going. - A. Sometimes running and sometimes walking; there was another young fellow walking by the side of him; he had the truss on his back, holding it with his two hands quite a stoop; I stopped him just going out of the passage from Austin Friars into Winchester-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by the goods. A. Yes; he did not give me any answer; he attempted to pitch the truss right upon me; I took hold of his collar and turned round and missed it; I took him to the Mansion-house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was out of employment; I went out about nine o'clock in the morning to look after employment; going along Threadneedle-street, I met this man, he asked me if I would carry this load for him he would give me half a crown. I was very glad to carry it for him; I followed him when I got into Winchester-street, that gentleman stopped me, accordingly I lost the man in a minute. I did not make the least resistance in the world.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

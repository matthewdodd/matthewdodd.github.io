            . On the 18th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, I was getting into the Fulham stage, on the west side of <placeName id="t18201028-31-crimeloc187">Dover-street</placeName>

I am certain it was the prisoner who snatched my watch - he was one of the crowd - they were returning from Hyde Park corner. I had a full view of his face, and saw the watch in his hand. I called Stop thief! pursued him about six yards, then got into the coach, and was informed he was taken. I found him in custody in a sadler's shop, not five minutes after. There was a very strong light. I am positive he is the man. I was very much hustled.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. It was dark - A. There were very strong gas lights in a shop. I saw him clearly, and saw it in his hand.</p>

            . I was in company with Read, close behind Mr. Filor - the sawyers were returning from Brandenburgh house - I saw the prisoner rush between him and Radauld, he put his left shoulder against Mr. Filor's right shoulder, and gave him a violent push. Supposing he had robbed him, I laid hold of him by the shoulder, and saw the watch pass; I believe it passed from his hand to another, who laid hold of it by the chain, it struck against a post, and the case fell off; the prisoner then got from my grasp, and was making off, when he saw the case on the ground, picked it up, and I secured him; my brother took it from his hand. I took him into a sadler's shop, Mr. Filor came in, and said he was certain he was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. His back was to you - A. No; his side. The case was picked up not four feet from the place.</p>

            . I was holding the coach door for Mr. Filor to get in; as he put one foot on the step the prisoner rushed up, and with main force hindered him from getting into the coach, and in a moment I saw the watch pass from towards him to a man, who ran away with it - it hit against a post, and the case came off. I instantly grasped at the prisoner, but could not stop him. He picked up the case, I collared him, and took him into the sadler's.

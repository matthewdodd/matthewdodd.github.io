I gave our porter a truse to carry to the waggon, he carried it and put it in the hind part of the waggon and returned back to the warehouse, I went out of the ware-house directly, he came back and saw the prisoner going down the gateway with the truss, I followed the prisoner and looked on the top of it and saw no direction on the top, I looked underneath and saw I. Harris and Pexton upon it. I catched hold of him by the collar and asked him where he was going with the truss, he said he was going to carry it to the waggon in the street, I told him no, he should not do that he should carry it back, he pulled to get away, I pulled him up the yard, I led him into the tap room and told our porter to take care of him. I went to the Comptor, got an officer and gave charge of him.</p>

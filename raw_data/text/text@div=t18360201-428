I am in the employ of John Howell and James of Regent-street—there are three other partners—it is in the parish of St. James—they have three houses next door to each other, which communi<lb></lb>cate below, but are separate above—one house is devoted to drapery and silk mercery business, the next house perfumery and china, and the other to jewellery—the jewellery business is carried on at No. 5—Mr. Charles Lee lives in that house—it is his separate dwelling-house—the shop is for the use of the firm—it communicates with the dwelling-house, and forms part of it—I was employed in that shop on Monday, the 21st of</p>

               <p>December, when the prisoner came in and requested me to show him some diamond rings—it was about three o'clock in the afternoon—they were shown to him—he said none of them were exactly the kind he wished; that he would call again in the course of land hour, and bring a ring of his own to have one like it—he afterwards wished to see some gold watches—he did not select any but said he would call again in an hour—he then left the shop—he might be there ten minutes or a quarter of and hour—I had shown him rings and watches in a tray containing a great many of each—I afterwards received information, and went to Young and Lux<lb></lb>more, pawnbroker, in St. Martin's-lane, at a little after seven o'clock that evening, and saw a watch which I knew to belong to Howell and Co.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of young and Luxmore, pawnbroker's St. Martin's-lane. The prisoner came to our shop on the 21st of December, at near six o'clock in the evening and brought a gold watch to pledge—he spoke in French, and asked 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I lent him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I consider it worth that—I heard afterwards that the prosecutors had been robbed, and sent to them that evening—the last witness came to me and saw the watch—the prisoner was apprehended next day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you ever seen the prisoner before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had before that day—his manners were gentlemanly—our shop window has nothing but plate in it—there was another customer in the shop.</p>

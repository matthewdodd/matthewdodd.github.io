On the 31st of July I was going home, about twelve o'clock at night: I found the gate shut, and could not get in; I went and stood in the middle of the street for the gate to be opened; the prisoner came and asked me twice if I did not want a lodging; I said No; he asked me a third time, and I told him to go along - he then ran with his full force against me, and pushed me down, struck me on the chest, and got hold of the ribbon of my watch; he very nearly got it, but I prevented it - I then felt his hand in my pocket; I heard the watchman coming - he then took to his heels, and ran off - the watchman followed, and took him; I lost sight of him, but I am sure he is the person.</p>

            . I am the watchman. On the 1st of August I took the prisoner, between twelve and one o'clock - McKenzie was in the road, and nobody near him - he was so alarmed and hurt he could hardly speak - he said he should know the man, and pointed which way he ran; I could not see him, but in a short time another watchman was driving the prisoner along, and desired me to see him out of the parish, as he was a bad character; I took him to the watch-house, and fetched McKenzie to the watch-house - he immediately said he was the man; there was nobody else near - McKenzie had been drinking, but was not intoxicated.</p>

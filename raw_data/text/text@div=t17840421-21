               <p>You had not missed any thing till you heard the cry of stop thief, had you? - No, I was not sure then that I had lost any thing.</p>

               <p>What was this quarrel between you and them? - One time I was coming down and I had a very bad foot, and the pavement is very narrow, and this woman pushed me off the pavement, and another came up and gave me three smacks on the face, I got a warrant for her.</p>
               <p>Court to Racey. What is it she says about going to shew you the ribbons? - These two women were in the shop, and came again and bought a yard and half of ribbon, and this woman when she went out, went with a pretence of looking for a ribbon, they are spread in the window; but instead of coming back she went off.</p>

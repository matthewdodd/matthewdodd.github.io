               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How far had the prisoner removed when you first challenged him? - As far as from here to the door.</p>
               <p>He might have dropped it before he came to that place? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at the gate; I heard a great noise, and by the Duke of Marlborough's wall, the prisoner came running towards me, a number of people after him; says I stop; no, says he, damn you, I will not stop; I hit him on the head with my stick, and caught hold of him, and he tumbled me down, he did not strike me; I got up again, and another man had hold of him; I saw nothing of the book till the other witness produced it; Owen came up after I fell; on searching him for the book, I found this pocket book, and something like country bank notes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When was it you saw this pocket book between the prisoner's legs? - When I came up to the prisoner, Macmanus had been thrown down. I believe he was got up again then; when I saw the pocket book between the prisoner's legs I was very near him.</p>
               <p>How long did you see it before it fell? - A very little time; the prisoner swore he had it not; he was struggling with Macmanus and the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

The prisoner is one of his apprentices, and had been so for about two years—he had been living with us three years—my husband had one other apprentice, and a journey mas, who worked for him, and who had served his time to his—he did not life with us—the two apprentices, my husband, myself, and three gentleman lodgers, lived in the house—there was no servant—on Sunday evening, 5th Dec., I am my husband went out soon after six o'clock, leaving the prisoner in the house—the other apprentice was out for the day, and the three lodgers, who were friends, had just passed down the street before us—there was no<lb></lb>body left in the house but the prisoner—my husband goes to Falcon-street Chapel, and I go to Church—while at Church, about seven, a neighbour gave me some information, which induced me to go home immediately—I found a crowd there, and I believe an engine—I think the prisoner was in the passage, but I am not quite certain—I immediately went up stairs to the bed-room, and found a policeman and fireman there—I had left the room door locked—when I got back, the catch of the lock was turned down and hanging by one screw as if it had been wrenched off—the bed-furniture was nearly all</p>

I live in Rahere-street, St. Luke's, and am an en<lb></lb>graver—the prisoner was my apprentice—I use turpentine in my trade—I have it in in small quantities—I had sent for a pint on the Friday before the fire—it was kept in a tin can used for the purpose, in a cupboard in the yard at the back of the house—I did not use any of that on the Friday, my wife did—I do not know what was done with it—I also use a composition resembling pitch—that was kept sometimes in the cupboard at the back of the house, and sometimes in the shop, where I do my engraving—this pro<lb></lb>duced is that kind of composition—I have brought a piece with me—the workshop is at the back of the house, built in the yard—there is a door open<lb></lb>ing out of the shop into the yard; and the cupboard, where the turpentine was kept, is about a foot and a half from that door—it opens into the yard—there is a back door leading from the house into the yard, and another door lead<lb></lb>ing from the yard into the shop—there is a small space between—on the evening of the fire I went to Falcon-square chapel—it generally takes me a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes to go there—I came out with my wife—all three of my lodgers left the house at the same time—I am not quite certain who left the house last, but I think it must have been me or my wife—we left no one in the house but the prisoner—while I was at chapel the prisoner came and told me a fire had taken place in my house, and that it had been put out with his assistance—I accompanied him back, and found the house in possession of the firemen—I went up to the back-room on the second floor, which is the top of the house, with the exception of a little loft—I saw there had been a fire there—it was then out—I went to the cupboard, where I kept papers on the shelves—it was open—some of the papers were burnt, and smelt very strongly of turpentine—there was also pitch on them—they were not all burnt, they were damaged by the fire—some were in bundles, and consequently were not burnt, and had no marks of fire on them—I kept this cash-box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) enclosed in a larger box, in the cupboard—it was locked safe on the Saturday night, and contained a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and five sovereigns—the keys were in my posses<lb></lb>sion—I had seen the money in the box about eight or nine o'clock on Saturday night—I had received the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note a few days before—I had on one occasion sent the prisoner out to fetch a sixpenny receipt stamp—I did not tell him for what purpose I wanted it—I think it was during the week previous—I was in the parlour when I sent him, and I think he brought it to me there—I think my customer was still there—the two boxes were locked, and the cup<lb></lb>board also—I had the key of the cupboard—it was locked on Saturday night at about eight or nine o'clock, and was not opened afterwards to my know<lb></lb>ledge—when I returned from chapel I found the cash box had been taken</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 36, Rahere-street. About half-past six o'clock, on the night of the fire, I saw the prisoner at the door of the house—it was almost momentarily after the alarm of fire—he had a dark japanned hand oil-lamp in his hand—it was alight—he said the fire was there—I asked how it occurred—he said he supposed it was by his mistress' taking a lamp up stairs, to dress for chapel; that the wick had fallen or blown off the top of the lamp, and set fire to the bed-curtains—I left him at the door, and went back to my own house, as I had left my door open—I saw several persons going in to the house at the time—I left him standing at the door.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman-sergeant, G</hi> 16.) On this Sunday I went to the house between seven and half-past, and found the prisoner there, with Mr. Hanaford, in the back parlour—these two boxes were produced—I asked if there was anybody to send for Mr. Hanaford, and the prisoner went—I went with the firemen into the top back bed-room—I noticed the door—there was a slight indent between the door and the wood-work, as though a screwdriver, or something of that sort, had been pushed in—there were two marks, one about six inches below, and the other about six inches above, the lock—I went to the cupboard door; it was wide open, and on one of the shelves, where the cash box was, close against the wall, and in front of the cash-box, was a quantity of paper—this burnt paper and pitch was by the side of the cash-box—a quantity of loose paper had been on fire, and this pitch was between it—the paper was very wet with turpentine and water—there was full half a bushel of paper, beside that which was burnt—the lock of the cash-box appeared to be towards the wall, and immediately over the cash-box, on the next shelf, was this hare's foot—the paper was on the shelf where the cash-box was, and on the shelf above it—there was an indent on the cupboard door, as though a screwdriver or some instrument had been used to force it open—it was near the lock, but more towards the door, so as to release the lock from the door, as if by being <hi rend="italic">prised</hi>—it had been forced back—the bolt of the lock had been released from the hasp—the bolt was shot when I saw it—I compared the marks with a screwdriver which Mr. or Mr. Hanaford gave me out of the back kitchen—it appeared that the same instrument had been used to open both doors—I have brought the cupboard door here, but not the room door—the marks on the bed-room door cor<lb></lb>responded with those on the cupboard door—the cash-box was on a shelf, and above that was another shelf, on which there was a quantity of loose paper, and just projecting over the shelf above the box was this hare's foot, quite saturated with turpentine, and the whole of the paper on both shelves was sprinkled with turpentine—the shelves were burnt a very little at the edge—at the top part of the bed-room door the paint was blistered by the fire, as though the fire had escaped after the door was opened—the bed furniture and some part of the things were burnt, and the chimney-board—I saw pitch in the cupboard and on the papers—the centre part of the paper was much more burnt than that above and below—that was n the shelf that the box was on—the edges of the paper above were burnt—some of the papers which were not burnt had stains of turpentine on them—I did not notice any marks of turpentine on the cupboard door—when his master came home, the prisoner and he went with me into the bed-room—I asked the prisoner how the fire originated—he said he did not know—I asked how he first discovered it—he told me he thought it was on the first floor, that he went there, and found it was not there, he went to the second floor, and found it was in his mistress's bed-room—I asked if the door was open, and he said it was shut—I asked bow he got it open—said he got a pair of tongs, and gave it a blow, it then gave way a little, and he pushed the remainder open with his hand—I examined the door—there were no marks of tongs on it—the prisoner was given into custody about eleven o'clock—he said, "It looks very black against me; I am innocent I not care for myself, only for my poor</p>

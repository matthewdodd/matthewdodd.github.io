I was in prison befor Chirst<lb></lb>mas, and sent for the prisoner to bail me out—he same to me, and I said, "Will you release me out of here?"—he said, "Yes, I will"—he put his hand in his pocket, and said, "I have got but half-a-crown and a few halfpence; have you got any?"—I said, there is 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on</p>

               <p>heard no more of her till I met the woman about the stoves, who said she was locked up for being disorderly, and said if I would go and get the stoves, she would give me one shilling and sixpence—I went to the prison to her about the stoves, she had not sent to me—she said the landlord would give her two pounds to give up possession of the house, and she told me to go and see if he would—she said, "There is some silver in the house"—she did not know how much—I paid one shilling and threepence for a copy of her commitment—I went to the house—there was nothing but an old mattress, four chairs, a door, and a rug—not finding the money, I would have advanced it, but I could not get any body to bail her, as they said she would be drunk again—I sent the copy of the commitment to her at the prison, by one Nicholson, with a letter, saying she had deceived me, and there was no money there—she had been four days in prison, and it is not likely she would have fourteen shillings on the shelf, and not send for it—I asked Tilley if he wanted a clock—he said he did, and unfortunately, the man who put it up, said it was his clock, he had sold it, to be paid for at two shillings a week, and he had never got a farthing for it—to show her abandoned character, no longer ago than the day I was committed, on the return of Tilley from Guidhall, he saw her rolling drunk in the street, on his way home—she is a notorious character—there was no furniture in the house—Nicholson went with me to look at the stoves, and I lent the key to a man named West, To sleep on the mattress in the house, and he can state what there was there.</p>

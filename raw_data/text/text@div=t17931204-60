             went out of doors to the passage, to rub the flat iron on a mat, and seeing a woman come down stairs alarmed her, not knowing such a person, she said good God, what are you doing here, what do you want, the street door was then on the latch shut, she ran into me to the kitchen, I snatched a candle off from the kitchen table, and ran into the passage as quick as I could, she did not make any kind of answer, she then was on the second step of the stairs coming down, trying to conceal herself in the corner of the stairs, I catched hold of her on the stairs, and she opened her cloak, and said I have got nothing; she did not seem<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040155"></xptr>intimidated, I pulled her down the stairs and sent for a constable, and I see her drop these things the officer took.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what time of the night it was? - It was about five minutes after five.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the clock had struck five? - Yes, quite five.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so dark you could not see any body in the street? - If she had got out of door I should not have known her.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lodgers have you in the house? - Two at present, but none of them were at home. I never heard the street door latch open, nor any person go up stairs; I had no idea of it.</p>
               <p>Q. It might be open and you not know it? - Yes, she must open it, and shut it likewise; there were two lodgers, the one on the first floor, and the other on the three pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the parlour? - There is no parlour. I have the ground floor, and the two pair of stairs was empty, the one pair of stairs to one lodger, and the three pair of stairs to another.</p>
               <p>Q. What things were taken out of the room? - One shift, one bed gown, three coloured aprons, three pair of cotton stockings, one window curtain, one white apron, three towels and a pillow case. They were all hanging up in the two pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way do you suppose the person got into your house? - There is no other way but at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the things found? - I saw her drop them on the stairs, she had them behind her, she had them not in her hands, as I took her down she dropped all the things on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the constable came? - About five minutes. I took her down into the kitchen, and the things dropped from her on the stairs, and I let the things be on the stairs till the constable came; I pulled her into the kitchen, because the street door will not open while any one is on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of this woman? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had nothing about me at all.</p>

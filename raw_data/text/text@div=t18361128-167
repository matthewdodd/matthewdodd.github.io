On Friday, the 25th of November, I got into an omni<lb></lb>bus at five o'clock, by the London Hospital, to go to the Bank—the pri<lb></lb>soner Johnson was the conductor, and Alexander the driver—I sat on the right-hand side, close to the door—the conductor was on my left as I went in—there was a female on the same seat as me, at the further end of the omnibus—a lady and gentleman got in at Whitechapel church, and alighted at Gracechurch-street—the lady continued on her seat all the way, and never moved—no one else got in till we got to the Bank—I had a purse in my pocket with one sovereign, two half-sovereigns, 4 duplicates, and a trifle of silver in it—about half a minute before I moved from my seat to get out I put my hand into my pocket to pay my fare, and found my purse perfectly safe, and a £5 note, which I also had folded in paper, with a crown piece and half-a-crown—it was wrapped up in paper, besides my purse, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am estate-agent and appraiser, and live at No. 37. Gilbert-street, Oxford-street. I was in the omnibus last Friday week—I got in at Bow Church, Cheapside, about half-past five o'clock—there was a lady in the omnibus, but not this lady—three or four got in before we got to St. Paul's—I cannot exactly say the time I got in—it was after six o'clock when I got home—they kept taking up and setting down between St. Paul's and Charing-cross—a lady and gentleman got out in the Strand, near the Adelphi, and the prisoner Johnson put his head in at the window, and said, "Has any body lost any thing?"—a gentleman sitting on my left asked what the property consisted of—he said, "I have found a purse"—the observation went round—five, six, or seven were in the om<lb></lb>nibus, and the answer given him was "No"—he then said. "I have found a purse, but there is no money in it"—he did not say what was in it—he set me down at the corner of Bond-street—there was a female in the om<lb></lb>nibus then, who looked like a servant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor and live at No. 16, James-street, St. Luke's. I got into the omnibus directly after it left the Mile-end gate, previous the prosecutrix getting in and there was female in it—the prosecutrix got in directly after we passed the London Hospital and pre<lb></lb>vious to getting to Whitechapel church, an elderly gentleman, who was very feeble, got in, and the prosecturix held her hand out to assist him in—directly after that we stopped again, and a lady and gentleman got in—we stopped at the Mansion House, and the prosecutrix got out, after shaking hands with a gentleman who sat on the opposite side—he had not got in with her—she got in, and the omnibus proceeded—and in some portion of the Strand the conductor asked if any lady or gentleman had lost any thing—he received an answer in the negative, and said he had found a purse—he did not say whether it contained any thing or not—I first saw the account of this robbery in the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi> newspaper, and afterwards saw handbills, which induced me to come forwards.</p>

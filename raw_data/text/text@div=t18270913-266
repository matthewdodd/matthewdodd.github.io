The prisoner, who was one of them, then spoke up violently, and said she would take my pockets off; she reached over the bar, took my handkerchief and shawl off, and ran away with them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the prosecutrix in liquor - several men were with her; I was afterwards in the Ship: she came in, and had some liquor; some time after she came with a beadle, and took me, but he let me go twice - he took me a third time; the prosecutrix is an unfortunate woman, and is not married.</p>

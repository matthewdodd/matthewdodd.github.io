            . I am constable of Enfield. I went to the prisoner's house on the 3rd of December - I found a great quantity of linen there; this is it - here are five cravats and other things; Mrs. Watson has selected some part of it, which she knows; some of it was in the washtub, some on the backs of chairs, and some on the washingform; there are from thirty to forty articles in all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they in the room into which the street door leads? A. Yes; the house is in a court, and as soon as I opened the door, these things were there.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was present at the search of the prisoner's house: I found this top of a lady's shift in an old saucepan, by the side of the fire, covered with water; it forms a whole shift with this other part, found by Mead.</p>
               <p>MRS. WATSON. This shift is one of the articles lost from my husband's house; it belongs to Mrs. Jones, of Hackney- it had her name on it, but it has been picked out - it was whole when I lost it; here is a table-cloth torn in half - it was whole when I lost it; here are some glass-cloths, with the name cut off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was brought to my house just as it is - I did nothing to it.</p>

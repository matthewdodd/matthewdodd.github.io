Between eight and nine o'clock on Sunday morning, the 20th of January, the prisoner came and asked the price of a leg of mutton; I said 7d. per lb.; she offered 6 1/2d., and I told my boy to weigh it; he said it was seven pounds and three quarters, which came to 4s. 2 1/2d.: she told me to sent it to Great Russel-street, with change for a sovereign; I put it into the boy's basket, and sent him with the change, but he was not to part with the meat or the change till he got the sovereign: he returned in about five minutes, and gave me a sovereign, which was a bad one, and said I was to send two pounds of beef suet: I went to the house the prisoner had described, but there was no such person known there: I then took my stick and went down to St. Giles's, where I saw the prisoner; I said I wanted her - she said she had never seen me or ordered any meat; this was within a quarter of an hour after she had been at my shop.</p>

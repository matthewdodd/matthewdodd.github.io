               <p>JAMES HANNAM. I am a porter in Messrs. Pickford's yard. On the 23d of July I was placed in the loft, in the warehouse, to watch the prisoner. I saw the prisoner break open a chest of soap. He took a cake of soap out of the chest. His wife came with his breakfast. She kept watch while he was doing it. She said, Thomas, make haste, you will have somebody come. He said, do not be in a hurry, He knocked the tin plate off a hogshead of sugar, and took out, as near as I can guess, twelve or fourteen pounds weight of sugar. He came to his wife with it. He asked her, whether she had brought a basket: she answered, no. He seemed quite hurt because she had not brought the basket. He went so some lump sugar that we had tied up in the accompting-house: he untied one of them and broke a great lump off it; he delivered the soap and sugar to his wife, and she went away with it. He went to the accompting-house and got some nails out of the desk: he took up one of the small weights and nailed the chest of soap up again. He went to the hogshead of sugar and nailed the tin plate on again: he put the weight down in its place again; he tied up the lump of sugar again, what he had broke a piece off; then he sat down and began his breakfast.</p>

             HAWKINS. On the 23d of July,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160058"></xptr> Mr. Holbrook came at an early hour for an officer. The prisoner lodged in Fleet-court, Fleet-lane. I went there in company of one of Mr. Pickford's men. I searched his room. I found two quantities of moist sugar, and a little bit of lump sugar, and about three or four pounds weight of soap, and a quantity of allspice and ginger that is not in the indictment. I left the prisoner in the custody of Prestow.</p>
               <p>- PRESTOW. I am an officer. On the 23d of July I went, in company with Hawkins, to Pickford's warehouse. I took the prisoner to the Compter while Hawkins searched his apartment. After Hawkins came back it was said to me, that they missed a great quantity of earthenware. I went to the prisoner's lodging. I found twenty-two dishes. I took an inventory of them: thirteen small ditto, thirteen large ditto, three white dishes, seventeen coffee-cups, and fifteen saucers, a large bowl, and four jugs. They are all here.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holbrook. Had you any sugar in your warehouse - A. Yes, and soap. I have a sample of the soap, and of the sugar. I believe the soap produced, and the sugar, to be my master's property, and all the earthern ware. We have two crates of this ware. Half of one crate is gone, of the same pattern with these now produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been clerk at a timber yard. On Wednesday, the 4th of February, I was in Essex-court, Whitechapel, with a woman—I went to sleep—I awoke between four and five o'clock—the person who had been in bed with me had gone—I instantly missed my top-coat, my under-coat, and waistcoat—I had four knives in the pockets, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my trowsers pocket, and three sovereigns in a purse; a razor; two silk handkerchiefs; a gold triangular seal, one stone was cornelian, the other amethyst, and the other plain gold—all this property was gone—I was stripped—I had laid down, having only taken off my two coats and waistcoat—I know nothing about the pri<lb></lb>soner—I had been drinking, but knew what I was about—I saw nobody in the house but the woman I went with—I understood it was her own apartment—I laid outside the bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went to No. 10, Essex-court, in the morning, and found the prosecutor sitting on the bed, with nothing but his shirt and trowsers on—on searching the room I found this handkerchief just behind the bed—and after the prisoner was apprehended at the station-house, I asked if he knew any thing of the handkerchief—he said, yes; that it belonged to him.</p>

                  </hi>. On the morning of the 5th of February, the prisoner came to my house, the Coach and Horses, in Whitechapel, between five and six o'clock—it was after four o'clock—I do not open till four o'clock—it might be between four and five o'clock—it was very soon after I opened—he came in with three or four more, without shoes or stockings on; but that I did not notice for an hour and a half after—he had a silk handkerchief round his neck, and a coat on—I do not think he had a shirt on—I was informed he had neither shoes nor stockings on—I went and ex<lb></lb>amined, and found it was so, and turned him out—I had drawn him some gin, and he asked me to change a sovereign—I gave him change—I saw another sovereign in his hand, which he asked me to change afterwards, and I refused—I did not see him afterwards—he came in with Foster, or nearly at the same time—several porters and people were in the room—</p>

               <p>he offered a dirty yellow handkerchief for sale, and I believe Foster gave him one shilling for it—there was a hole in it—I do not think there was any red on it, but it was at a distance from me—I live three hundred yards from Essex-court.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner at Plant's house, between four and five o'clock in the morning—he had on a great coat and a red handker<lb></lb>chief—his coat had a sort of brown silk buttons; it was a dark mixture coat—he had a triangular seal in his hands, and I saw him with two sove<lb></lb>reigns and some silver—he had something to drink—the triangular seal had different coloured sides, red and white, and the other was gold—I saw him afterwards in Petticoat-lane, selling the great coat, which he had on—I did not see who he sold it to, and do not know what he sold it for—I asked him where he got it—he said he stole it—I am sure he said so—he bought a jacket afterwards—I know he lived in Essex-court—I saw him go in there every day—I live in Keate-street—I do not know whether he sleeps in Essex-court—he lived there with Margaret Brown—I lived with her a little time to go on errands, and he lived with her at the same time—I had seen him there about a week before the robbery.</p>

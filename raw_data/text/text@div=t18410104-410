I lodged at the Welsh Harp public-house, in Essex-street, on the 15th of November—I had taken too much liquor, I went up stairs, and the prisoner was sent up to see if I had got safe to bed—I saw my watch in my possession a little after eight o'clock, and next morning I missed it—the one now produced is mine.</p>

On the 15th of November I told him to see the prosecutor to bed, and undress him—on the 25th the prisoner was still in my employ—he asked leave to go out that evening, saying he had got a hurt from a ladder, and wished to consult the doctor about his side, which he had hurt—in consequence of suspicion, I after<lb></lb>wards</p>

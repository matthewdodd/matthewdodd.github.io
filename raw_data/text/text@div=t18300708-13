On Tuesday, the 29th of June, I cleaned the plate, and locked the plate-closet door - it was then quite safe; I then went to another part of the house - I heard a little noise, and thought it was the bird at the window - I heard it again, and thinking it was the rattling of the spoons and forks, I went to the pantry, and saw both the prisoners in the pantry, in the act of taking the plate out of the closet; I immediately ran in, and laid hold of Taylor - Thomson ran out of the pantry, past me; Taylor tried to escape - I knocked him down in the front hall, and secured him, but he afterwards escaped from me at the door; I immediately gave an alarm of thieves, and ran after him - the front door was open; he was secured about one hundred yards off - Thomson had run in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080019"></xptr>a different direction; one of the labourers stopped Taylor - he up with his fist and knocked him down; that man then ran after Thomson and secured him - they were handcuffed and taken to a public-house; I returned to our house, and on a small table in the pantry found a yellow handkerchief, containing these spoons and forks, and another handkerchief by the side of it; the handkerchief was not tied up, but the plate laid on it - they were plated articles, except four spoons and a fork; I had put them into the closet about twenty minutes before, and locked the door - the table was by the side of the closet; I received information from Gillham, and by the garden wall found a silver watch and guard, belonging to me, about a quarter of an hour after; it hung on a hook in the pantry, opposite the plate-closet, about ten minutes before I saw the prisoners there; I cannot form any judgment of its value.</p>

No, the Sardanian - he is a Count; I do not know whether he has other titles - he is called Count D'Anglie; Taylor was secured in a very few minutes - I did not lose sight of him above half a minute.</p>
               <p>HENRY GILLHAM. I am a groom. I was riding by the prosecutor's house, and heard somebody cry out Halloo! I immediately saw two men making their escape from the house, and heard somebody call Stop thief! they ran in different directions - I followed Thomson, and saw him throw something over the garden wall: I pointed out the place to Curry - I was opposite Thomson when Almond stopped him; I am certain of him, for I was close to him all the time - he said it was merely a lark, and offered Almond 1s. to let him go.</p>
               <p>ROBERT ALMOND. I heard a cry of Stop thief! near the house, and ran after Thomson, who was running down by the lodge-gate, in a direction from the house; I stopped him, and delivered him to the constable, who had got Taylor.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CALDER. I am a Police-constable. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw Taylor struggling with Miles' workman, and secured him; he had no hat on - I found a dozen lead pencils on him, and two dozen on Thomson.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

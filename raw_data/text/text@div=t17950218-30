            , to let Mr. Gant have it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity to deliver? - Upwards of five hundred quatero; housed to send for twenty or thiety quarters a day.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was to be delivered on that day? - They were to deliver thirty-four quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only order for that day delivered to them? - It was, there was no other delivered to them that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Chandler any person employed by you at any time? - No, I never see Chandler before I see him the night he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any corn was missing from that place? - When the bulk of corn went away, the quantity that was in that warehouse was cleared away, there appeared to be a deficiency of fifty-two quarters and four bushels; it was cleared away in two or three days. The quantity was six hundred and one quarters when landed, and when it came to go away it was fifty-two quarters short of that.</p>
               <p>Q. After Pearce had delivered this quantity that was ordered for Mr. Gant, was it his business to stay in the warehouse, or quit? - I gave him orders to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180068"></xptr>stay in the warehouse till six o'clock at night, left Mr. Gant might send for more.</p>
               <p>Q. But no more than the thirty-four quarters were sent for by Gant? - No, not that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You superintend this warehouse and employed a number of hands to deliver out the corn? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner do you give them the order? - I give them a written order and tell them who are the persons that are coming for the corn, and the persons that come for the corn bring a written order.</p>
               <p>Q. On this occasion, there was a bulk called Mr. Gant's bulk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had desired Pearce to deliver out a quantity to Mr. Gant? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Gant sent different carts and waggons for that quantity? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there when it was delivered? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't know what carts or what waggons he sent, or what persons he sent? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that corn has not been given out without a written order? - Never without I give a verbal order.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in the case of Gant; Mr. Gant was a person that bought a great quantity of you; in such a case it was possible to have corn delivered without having a written order? - He gave an original order at once.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that for every small quantity there was a written order given? - It always was, except it was a person that had corn frequently, that was known perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in a case like that of Mr. Gant's it has happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. That delivered to Mr. Gant, was it delivered by written order or not? - It was delivered by written order.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there could be no verbal order in the case of Mr. Gant? - There could not.</p>
               <p>Court. The quantity that was delivered to Gant that day was delivered by a written order? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The question I put to you is this, If such a man who had corn often, if he had applied to Pearce without your knowledge, whether Pearce would have been justified in letting him have it? - Mr. Gant would have sent down a note by him at night.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is, if in that day Mr. Gant having received all according to the written order, had thought fit to have sent

               <p>Q. Where did you go with the cart? - To Millbank, Westminster, just by the ship, the gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go with the cart for? - For five quarters of corn. The man at the left hand side, standing at the bar(Chandler) he came to hire the cart, he went with me and came back with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you get the corn of? - That man, Pearce helped up the sacks, and Chandler wheeled it to me; it was the ground floor, about even with the tail of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what corn it was? - Oats.</p>

            When you got to Dunn's house, what became of the oats? - The oats were taken up into a room, a granary house.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was present to receive them? - Mr. Dunn. Chandler backed them to the tail of the cart to me, and I carried them up to Dunn's premises.</p>

               <p>Q. If you don't convict somebody else you may be charged yourself; you carried the oats, you took these oats, therefore if you do not charge somebody else you may be put in prison yourself? - I cannot charge any body else.</p>

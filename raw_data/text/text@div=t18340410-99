            . I am a police-constable. On the 25th of February, Dorset gave me information - I was on duty in Church-street, Bethnal Green - at the top of Brick-lane - I walked down until I came within two doors of the prosecutor's shop, and saw the prisoner Bradley stooping down to the window, and Castles walking backwards and forwards, about a yard each way - Bradley was stooping down with his hands to the window; but, what he was doing, I could not see - I crossed over, and both the prisoners then came from the window, and came towards me - I immediately seized them both, and took them into Mr. Harper's, the baker's shop, in Brick-lane - I searched Bradley, and found on him a steel chain, a metal seal, and a pair of ear-rings - but, on Castles, I found nothing belonging to the prosecutor - I took them to the station-house, with the assistance of my brother officer - I afterwards went back to the prosecutors, and saw a pane of glass broken - the putty seemed as if a sharp instrument had been put in, to break the window - I do not consider sufficient of the glass was gone, for a man to put his hand through - the prosecutor's daughter gave me a piece of wire, crooked at the end - I have it here.</p>

            . I live at No. 88, Hare-street, Bethnal-green - I deal in clothes, and sometimes other things, in Petticoat-lane - about ten weeks ago, I sold Castles a chain like that, but there are so many hundreds alike, it is impossible to say this is it - as far as I can take my oath, it was exactly like this, there was no seals to it - he put two seals on it - a woman brought me to the dock to see if I could identify him as the man, and I could - I know him because he asked me to give him a stoutish pin, I gave him one, and he pinned the chain to his fob - I thought it strange to buy a chain without a watch, which made me notice him - this happened at my stall in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Castles. The seals belong to my father - the prosecutor would have sworn to them before the magistrate, if I had not said so.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA BOUCHARD re-examined. I said I thought one of the seals was like what was in my window, but I did not like to swear to it - a great many more things were missing from my window - I do not swear to the seals.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CASTLES. I am the brother of the prisoner - I can take my oath I saw that chain in my brother's fob before he was taken, and the two seals belong to my father - he had the chain in his possession a fortnight before he was taken - I did not see him buy it - he has worn the seals ten years - my father is alive, but is not here.</p>
               <p>Castles. Dorset went to my mother and said, if she would pay him his expenses he would not come against me.</p>
               <p>JOHN DORSET re-examined. I did not do so - ever since they have been in custody their friends have come backwards and forwards to me to bribe me not to come, but I would not listen to it - they have threatened me even in the yard - I belonged to the Hampshire militia - Mr. Alderman Wood was the colonel - I was out four days, and Castles' friends charge me with being a deserter.</p>

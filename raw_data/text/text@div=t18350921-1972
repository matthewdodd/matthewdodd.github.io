                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Hudson, a music-seller. On the 12th of August, at ten o'clock at night, I was in Charles-street, Drury-lane, walking with my daughter—I had my reticule in my hand, with the string twisted round my finger—It was snatched from me at the corner of Charles-street, and the broken string left twisted round my finger—I never recovered it—the person ran away—I followed him—the prisoner resembles the man in height and stature, but he was differently dressed—I cannot tell whether he is the man—he made his escape—this was Wednesday-night—I saw the prisoner last Monday at Bow-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Drury-lane. I have known the prisoner nearly six months—I observed him frequently idling about but never spoke to him—I stood at the door of the house, where I have lived nine years, and saw a whole lot of young fellows standing at the corner—the policeman came and sent them away, and in a few minutes the prisoner came back with one or two more—two ladies came up with reticules of a dark colour—the prisoner stood inside a place, and snatched the reticule, and ran away—I saw him do it—the lady cried, "Stop thief"—I followed the lady, and told her to go no further, or she might get hurt—I was telling somebody what I had seen, and the policeman heard me—the prisoner was not in a company with any body when he did it.</p>

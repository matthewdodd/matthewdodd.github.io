I ran backwards directly, and when I came into the yard, the prisoner stood in the yard, on a plank which supports the wall from falling, it is an old wall, he stood with the sheets in his arms, I don't know rightly the length of ground he might be distant from my house; my yard is very small; I ran to him, and pulled the sheets from him, and he jumped over the wall, and I screamed stop thief! I immediately ran back screaming all the way I went; this gentleman that is here pursued him, and took him on a vacant piece of ground at the back of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same man that you took the sheets from? - I am very sure, and I am very sorry about it; he had a hat on then, and the same jacket he had on that he has on now; the sheets are here, the constable has them; I gave them to him the next day, one is my own, and the pair was a person's up stairs, that I am paid for washing of them, I am answerable for the sheets, there were three linen sheets in all; my own was marked, I. A. C. No. 2. I am confident of the others they are the same sheets, because I pulled them from his hands before he was out of the yard; had they been out of my sight I could not have been so positive.</p>

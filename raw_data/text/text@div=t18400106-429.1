                  </hi>I am a broker, and live in Drury-lane. On Sa<lb></lb>turday morning, the 4th of January, I had seven yards of oil-cloth—directly I opened the shop I went backward—a neighbour came in and told me something—I ran out and saw the prisoner, in Great Wild-street, in custody of an officer—the prisoner gave the floor-cloth to the police<lb></lb>man, and ran away—he passed me—I caught his coat, and tore one side off—I chased him down to Clare-market, and there lost him for a few minutes—a gentleman passing said he had run into the Black Jack pub<lb></lb>lic-house—the policeman went in, and found him with a short pipe and a pint of beer—I can swear to him—this is ray floor-cloth.</p>

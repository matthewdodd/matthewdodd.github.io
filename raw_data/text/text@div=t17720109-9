I had every thing in the indictment about me. The next morning I missed my watch, a guinea and a quarter, the key of my portmanteau, and four shillings in silver, out of my breeches that were under my head. The portmanteau was carried out into the field; out of that I lost a coat and waistcoat, four shirts, seven pair of stockings, three handkerchiefs, two silk and a linen one, three neck-cloths: There was a pair of breeches, and a new piece of nankeen left in the fields; they were in the portmanteau with the other things. The prisoner was a lodger in the house; he laid with me; he went away that morning before day-light, and has not been heard of since till last night; his absconding made me suspect him; I went down to Portsmouth after him, as I had an information that he was there; he was gone from thence, and we found him in Buckinghamshire, near Fullmore, in a born a threshing; he had my hat on his head, and these things were in the house. (Producing a waistcoat and three shirts, four pair of stockings, and a linen handkerchief.) These were part of the things I lost, I knew them by my marks; he said he took them from me, and he show'd me where he sold the watch, it was to

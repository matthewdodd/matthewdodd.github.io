On the 14th of October, about seven or eight o'clock at night, I was going to Deptford, and met the prisoners in Broad-street, Westminster; they got hold of my arms, and said they would not let me go till I treated them with a glass of gin; I went to two different houses, and gave them a glass at each - they then would not let me go, but led me to a little room, threw me on a bed, and continued their talking, and wanted more liquor; I got drowsy - I did not go to sleep; I felt their hands rubbing about me; I had all these articles in a bundle on the bed, and the sovereign in a little fob in my waistcoat - they got that out; I felt them searching me; I fell asleep, and then they got hold of me, and threw me out of doors - I awoke - I was in liquor; I called for my hat, and presently they threw my hat and purse out - I did not move from the door till the watchman came in the morning, at six o'clock - another man had told him of it; he called out, but they would not open the door; he sent me for another watchman - they then got in, and searched the house; they found an old apron, which I had bound three times round my waist - I have found nothing else; nobody but the prisoners were in the house - they were in the same bed as they dragged me into; I was asleep when they took the bundle - I had not undressed.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The watch-house is in Perkins'-rents, Old Pye-street; a man came and told me a poor working man had been robbed; I went down to the house, which I had known of old, and saw the prosecutor; I knocked at the door, but could get no answer - I then sent for the next watchman, who came- I then knocked again, and said if they did not open it I would break in; a voice said "Wait a bit;" I then heard a running to and fro in the passage - we went into the house, and found nothing; the other watchman found this apron in the yard; it is very unusual for the door to be shut at all, but that night it was well bolted; there are some cow-houses at the back of the yard.</p>

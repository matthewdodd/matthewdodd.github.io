               <p>JOHN COLLYER. I am a gardener, and live at Newington-green - the prisoner came to me and said my boy had stolen two rabbits from him - I told him I did not know how that could be - he said he had, and he would have them - I told him I was not satisfied about that, and should not give them up till I had got a policeman - my boy had brought two rabbits to my house - I followed the prisoner down into the brick-field, about three hundred yards; he kept saying he would have them - when I got down there I saw another boy hiding behind the bricks - I asked the prisoner what that boy was hiding from me for - he said he had got two other rabbits like his - I asked what he was frightened at - the boy said he was frightened at me - I asked why he should be frightened - he said he did not know - the prisoner asked me again for the rabbits - I said,"When I get a policeman, and am satisfied they are yours, you shall have them" - on looking round I saw a large cave made out of a clump of bricks, large enough to conceal two persons - I asked him where my boy took the rabbits from- he said out of that place - I had my little daughter with me, and I sent her for a policeman who lives opposite, but he was not at home - presently the prisoner turned round, undid his jacket, and took out this chopper - he flourished it about, and swore with an oath that he would kill my boy for taking his rabbits - he went in a direction to meet him as he was coming - I ran after him, took the chopper from him, and he ran away; and the boy who was hiding in the bricks ran with him; and we found hid under some bricks two more rabbits and the mole-trap - the rabbits are all here now.</p>
               <p>EDWARD HARVEY re-examined. This is my master's chopper and mole-trap - his name is James Adamson.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FIELDWICK. I am servant to Mr. Collyer - I work in the gardens - I found the rabbits in the hole, and took them to Collyer's house - I was going out on an errand for master through the fields, and on going by the clump of bricks, I saw a mole-trap; and on looking into a hole I saw the rabbits, and took them to my master's house - the prisoner afterwards charged me with stealing them - I was returning and saw the prisoner and a boy - he said, "Did you see a man here?" I said, "No;" he said, "I saw a man here, and when he saw me he ran away - I went for a policeman, and when I came back there were four rabbits here, and you have got two of them" - I told him they were at master's house - he said he saw me run up the field with two rabbits in my hand - I had seen nobody when I took them - there were wild rabbits in the field, and I did not know at the time that these were not wild - he went to master's house directly - the field is about three-quarters of a mile from Harvey's.</p>
               <p>JAMES PLAYFORD. I am a policeman - I took the prisoner into custody at Collyer's - I produce the rabbits.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Collyer's house, and asked him if his boy brought the rabbits there - he said "No;" I said, I would have them, and they were there - I said,"I must have them, they don't belong to me, but to another boy" - I knew nothing about them, only seeing the other boy with them in the basket - I told Collyer so - I took the chopper off the bricks.</p>
               <p>J. COLLYER re-examined. He did not say they belonged to another boy - he said they were his - the chopper was not on the bricks, he took it from his jacket.</p>

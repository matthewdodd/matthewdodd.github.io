                  </hi> I am foreman to Mr. Henry Bodman, a tailor, of the Strand. Previous to the 24th of Nov. I missed a considerable quantity of property from the shop—Metcalf was in our employ—he is about fourteen years old-Russell was the domestic servant—on Wednesday, the 25th of Nov., I marked a piece of angola, and put it on the counter in the shop—it was there that evening—I missed it the next morning, the 26th—there were two yards and a quarter of it—this is it.</p>

I received directions to watch Mr. Bodman's premises—I went there on the evening of the 21st of Nov.—I saw Russell leave the premises between seven and eight o'clock—she went to Pitts'-place, Drury-lane—she met Evans just outside her door—they appeared on friendly terms—Russell said, "As I have got out, I thought I would run down and see you; where are you going to?"—they went from one place to another—they went to a butcher's shop, and remained in company some time—I saw them drink together, and saw them part after they came out of a public-house—I did not show myself to either of them—I was in plain drees—on the 26th of Nov. I went again to Mr. Bodman's—I followed Metcalf, who came out of Mr. Bodman's—I did not see that he had anything with him—he went to Mrs. Evans's, in Pitts'-place, Drury-lane—I saw him come out in a short time—I spoke to him, and asked him what he had taken there—I went to Evans's, and told Metcalf to stand back—I called Evans myself—I asked her what the boy had brought there—she said a gown-piece that Mrs. Russell had sent her to look at, to see how she liked it—I asked her if she would show it me—she said it was in a box, she would go and get it—she went and fetched it, and from a pattern I had in my pocket, I saw it was the trowsers-piece that Mr. Bodman had lost that morning—I said it was not a gown-piece, it was a trowsers-piece that Mr. Bodman had lost that morning, and it was stolen—she began to cry—I told her she must go to the station with me—she said she hoped not, she would give me anything if I would not take her, and anybody would be answerable for her appearance in the morn<lb></lb>ing—she said she wished she had never known Mrs. Russell, and no doubt the waistcoat-piece she pawned some time before, was come by in the same way—she said the boy had told her it was all right—I searched her lodging, and found forty-four duplicates, ten of them relate to property belonging to Mr. Bodman, and which was identified by the foreman, and is now here—I went to Mr. Bodman's, and apprehended Russell—I told her she must go with me to the station for robbing her master—she said, "Very well"—on the road to the station she asked me where we were going—I told her to Bow-street—she asked if the boy was there—I said yes, he was—I had not given her any intimation of the boy having done anything.</p>

                  </hi> (a <hi rend="italic">prisoner.</hi>) I was fourteen years old last June—I went into Mr. Bodman's employ about seven months ago—Russell was servant in the house—I knew nothing of her before I went there—some time after I went there she told me to go and take a waistcoat-piece—I was to take it down stairs to take to Mrs. Evans—that was the direction Russell gave me—she told me on various occasions to do things in the shop—on the 25th of Nov. I observed this piece of cloth that is produced, in the shop—Russell told me to take a piece to-morrow morning, and when I opened the shop in the morning, I took the piece, and took it down to Russell in the kitchen—she told me I was to take it to Mrs. Evans the first time I could get out in the day—she told me to place it in the back kitchen—the first time I got out was in the evening, before I went home to bed—I then took it to Mrs. Evans, and the policeman followed me—when I got to Mrs. Evans's with the cloth I told her I brought it from Mrs. Russell—she said, "Very well"—when I came out the policeman took me—he asked me what I took there—I said it was a gown-piece that the servant had sent to show Mrs. Evans—nobody had told me to say that—I went into the house with the officer, and heard what passed between him and Evans—I did not know anything at all of Mrs. Evans till Russell sent me there—I had been ten or a dozen times to Evans's before the officer took me—all these things which have been produced relating to these duplicates are what I had taken from my master's to Evans's—the first time I took any was about two months ago.</p>

            . I live in the Borough, and attend the Justice's at the rotation. The prosecutor came to me about the ninth of August last, and informed me his house had been broke open. I told him I had reason to believe some of his goods were at one Silva's, for I had been so informed by one Griffiths, who had been indicted for the same offence, We went to Silva's with a search warrant; there we found two glasses, four bowls, and a delph dish. ( They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Silva. I am a carpenter, and keep a pawnbroker's shop. I have known the prisoner two or three years; he worked with Mr. Cooper, a gardiner: I met the prisoner in the street in company with two other men on a Sunday: after I passed them the prisoner turned round, and went home with me; he asked me to buy the china, that has been produced; I told him I did not chuse to deal with him, it being Sunday: he asked me two shillings for them, I told him that was too much, then he asked me to lend him eighteen pence upon them, and said; he would bring some other things the next morning; I let him have the eighteen-pence: the next morning he brought the two glasses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I pawned them for the two men that were with me.</p>
               <p>Silva. The prisoner was the principal person, the other said nothing, and the prisoner received the money.</p>

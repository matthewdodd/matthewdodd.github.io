            . I am a milkman, and live in George-place, Holloway. I keep my cows in a field adjoining Mr. Dawson's premises - I went there about seven o'clock in the evening, on the 20th of February, and heard something on the houses; I went up to the cows - returned, and heard the noise again; it appeared to be on the slates of the house - I heard it several times, and at nine o'clock I spoke to the watchman - we went to the houses; I stopped in front, while he went round - the prisoner and another person came down from inside one of the houses - the other got away; I followed the prisoner for near a mile, and near the New North Bridge; I called for him to be stopped, and he was stopped - I had never lost sight of him; I am certain he ran from the house where I heard the knocking - I went on the roof after he was secured and found five pieces of lead weighing more than 200 lbs. rolled up, it was quite fresh cut.</p>

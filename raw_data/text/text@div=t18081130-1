            . I am a carpenter. On the 3d of October, about half past six in the morning, I was going to my work, I met the prisoner Hankey with the copper on his shoulder in Greek street; I did not take any particular notice then, but went on to my work in Soho square; I saw the prisoner Clark come out of a house at the corner of Greek street; he shut the door after him and spoke to another man, and they both went down Bateman's buildings; that is the turning after Greek street.</p>
               <p>Q. That other man is not here - A. No; he was here last sessions. I thought they had no business in the house; I went on to my work, I met the witness Hathaway; from his information we followed them down Greek street, and just as we got to Queen street the other two men came up.</p>
               <p>Q. What two other men came up - A. Clark and Procter. We proceeded to follow Hankey, that had the copper on his shoulder, into Litchfield street; there he knocked at the door and took the copper in.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning might that be - A. About twenty minutes to seven. I was about half a dozen doors off when he knocked at the door; as soon as I got up to the door he was coming out again without the copper; I met him at the door and laid hold of his collar; I told him that he was my prisoner; he asked me what for.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you an officer - A. No. He immediately up with his fist and struck me on my breast, gave himself a wrench and got away from me, and ran into Grafton street, where Clark and Procter was standing; he ran between them, made a kind of a stop. Clark said something to him and he run off again directly into West street, into Castle street, and into the Seven Dials, where there is a great many turnings, there I lost him: I turned back to the place where the copper was left, I met Procter there; directly he saw me he ran away: I ran after him with the cry of stop thief; he was stopped in Newport market; I took him before the magistrate; he was tried last sessions.</p>

            . On the 3d of October, at half past six in the morning, I was going to work, I saw two men lurking about at the house, 27, Soho square, the corner of Greek street; I looked at them and I saw one of them go up to the door; a working man was coming by; he came away; I went up to the rails of Soho square, and I saw the prisoner Hankey go up to the door again of No. 27; the door was opened and he went in. I ran to our shop, which was about an hundred yards from the square, and told the men what I saw; they did not come with me; I ran back again, and as soon as I got in the square I saw Hankey come out of No. 27, with the copper on his shoulder; Clark came out afterwards and pulled the door after him and was talking with Procter, that was with Hankey; they all went down Bateman's buildings, that come, into Greek street. I met with the witness Packer; I told him what I saw, and we followed the man with the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the copper on his shoulder then - A. Hankey; and the other two men were behind; I followed them to Mr. Sholey's, 27, Litchfield street; he knocked at the door; the door was opened, and he went in. I turned my head round to look for the other two prisoners; Hankey came out and ran away; I ran after him and lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Hankey was the man - A. No, I am not sure that he was the man, because I was at a distance from him; it was something of the same sized man; he has a different dress on now.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him now - take your time - A. I am almost sure it is the same man. We turned back and met with Procter; he saw us and ran away; we ran after him and cried out stop thief; he was stopped by the butchers in Newport market.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the man that was tried - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the copper - A. Packer fitted it in the place where it was taken from.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Neither of the three men that you have been speaking to had you ever seen before - A. Procter and 
               <persName id="t18081130-1-person58">Clark</persName>
             I have seen before, and knew them.</p>
               <p>Q. Hankey you had never seen before - A. No. I saw him at the door with Procter; I saw his face plain.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from him - A. About twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Q. When Hankey was taken to the police office, you was taken there to identify him - did not you tell the magistrate that you by no means could say it was the man - A. I told the magistrate I could not positively swear to him; but now I see him I know the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your memory is helped by a longer time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you now attempt to say he is the man, yet a quarter of an hour ago you could not - A. I can swear he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You indicted this man along with Procter, who was tried last sessions - A. He was indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen him from the time he was engaged carrying the copper, when you before the grand jury - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300004"></xptr>Q. You did not know whether his name was Hankey or Smith - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. to Packer. What became of the copper - A. After I took Procter to the watchhouse, I went back to Mr. Sholey the coppersmith, and told them that they had got a copper; I went into their work shop, and there were three coppers; there I pointed to one, and said a man brought that one in this morning; I knew it to be the copper that Hankey took in; I put my name on the copper, and afterwards I fitted it to the place where it was taken from.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this copper that you found on Hankey's shoulder, you took and fitted to where - A. No. 27, Soho square, the corner of Greek street.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was that - A. Mr. Gedge's.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very sure then that the copper you found there you had seen on Hankey's shoulder, and that it fitted that place. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You had never seen any of the men before - A. I knew Clark; the other men were perfect strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go into Mr. Sholey's where you found the copper, till after you took Procter to the watchhouse - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that take place - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore what they do at Mr. Sholey's place you do not know, you found a copper there - A. Yes, and two others.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Sholey here - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gedge. Is your house the corner of Greek street in Soho square - A. It is No. 27, Soho square; the corner of Greek street.</p>

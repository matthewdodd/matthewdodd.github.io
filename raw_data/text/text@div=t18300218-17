On the 25th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the back parlour, and heard a cry of Stop thief!

            . I was in the parlour behind the shop, sitting opposite the door; I saw the prisoner come in, and take something off a small table - I had shortly before that told the young man to take these cravats from the door; I saw the prisoner take them from the table, and go off with them; I could see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180022"></xptr>what he had got-he was brought back by Mr. Griffin and a ticket-porter; the property is worth 4s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said at the Mansion-house that the person had a detriment in his eye? A. I said he had a very curious look in his eye, which I think you have.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HUGHES. I am shopman to Mr. Griffin. I saw the prisoner come into the shop, take three cravats, and instantly gave an alarm; Mr. Griffin went out - I followed him, but before I overtook him the prisoner was in custody; I recollected his features, and am quite certain of his person - he had run half-way up 'Change-alley; the things have not been found.</p>

            . I am a ticket-porter. I heard a cry of Stop thief! the prisoner was coming towards me, running fast. and I stopped him; I did not observe any thing with him - I took him into the shop; Hughes and Mrs. Griffin immediately said he was the person - he said he was no thief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I could have got away, could not I? A. Not from me - you made no resistance.</p>
               <p>SARAH TOWNESEND. I live in Coppice-row. I was at tea at Griffin's; I saw the prisoner stoop down, come in, and take the property off the table - previous to that three boys came in, one with a petition, another to ask for tape, and a third to sell pens: while the one was offering pens the prisoner came in - I am confident he is the man: as he took the bundle his eye caught mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How far was you from the person? A. About six yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to the west-end of the town, looking for work; in my way home I ran up this court, being cold, and that caused a crowd.</p>

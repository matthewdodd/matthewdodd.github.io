                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Miss Emily Chappell, a music<lb></lb>seller, who lives in New Bond-street. On the 23rd of September, 1840, a man called and said that Mrs. Pugh, of No. 41, Curzon-street, May Fair, wished to hire a good harp—I went to the house to make inquiries—I saw Mrs. Mitchell, who told me she was the landlady—she said Mrs. Pugh was a lady of very large fortune, and she had a good reference with her from Mr. Squire's, a merchant, in the City—the harp was sent the same afternoon—on the 23rd of October the prisoner called, and said she came to pay for the month's hire of the harp, and asked me to make out a bill, which I did—I asked her name, and she said, "Mrs. Pugh, No. 41, Curzon-street"—she paid me two guineas for the month's hire, and said she wished to continue it at the same rate—I called at the house three months afterwards—the servant said the prisoner was gone into the country, but was expected shortly to return—I heard of Mr. Squire's, I think, in July, from Mrs. Mitchell, and I saw him—he is a merchant—apparently, he lived in Bucklersbury—he said he was the prisoner's agent,</p>

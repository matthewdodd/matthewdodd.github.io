             sworn. I am porter to Mr. Gray; I took the cart out with goods to deliver, about the middle of the day, from the Bell Savage, I arrived in Milk-street, next to Lad-lane, about two, I drove up <placeName id="t18061029-27-crimeloc159">Milk-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. You are sure it is the same man. - A. I knew him before he went to the cart, by sight, he has been a carman; I produce the saddle bags, they are the saddle bags that were given into my possession.</p>

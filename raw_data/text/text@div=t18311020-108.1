            . I am a Policeman. On the 20th of September, at seven o'clock in the morning, I was on duty opposite the prosecutor's shop, and saw the prisoner come out of the shop; he began to clean the window, then beckoned to a boy who stood in a court, and pointed down Charles-street; the boy took the hint, and went down that street - the prisoner directly left the shop, and went down that street, towards him; I followed, and seeing me he went into his master's shop again - he went through the shop, and was going out at the back door; I followed, and took him, and in his hat found this tea, in paper, covered with a handkerchief.</p>

I went into the shop about seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner at a tea-canister - I saw him put his hat on his head, and then put the lid on the canister; he afterwards took his hat off, and appeared to be smoothing something in it - he then went out to dust the windows.</p>

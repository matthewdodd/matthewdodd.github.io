            . I am a headborough of St. Luke's. On the 27th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Moorfields, with a plank of fir, fourteen feet long, on his shoulder; I followed him down Ropemaker-street, Chiswell-street, through different alleys, into Chequer-alley, I then asked him what he had got? he said it was wood that he had brought from over the water. I asked him where he was going to take it, he said, to a bedstead maker in Bunhill-row. I told him he had passed Bunhill-row, he then said he wanted to take some meat home first, and that he came over London bridge. He put the plank off his shoulder, and asked me to mind it while he went home with his meat. I secured him. The next morning I compared the wood against the old wall in Moorfields, and it fitted the holes both in the wall and in the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fancy pearl-cutter, and live in Church-lane, Bloomsbury. On the evening of Friday, the 13th of April, my brother-in-law came to sup with me—we had some beer brought from Mr. Mason's, the Robin Hood public-house—it came in a can, and an empty quart pot with it—I believe Mr. Mason's name was on the pot, but I did not look—my brother left me about ten o'clock at night—I missed the quart pot about twelve o'clock the next morning—I had reason to believe my brother-in-law took it away—I sent for him—he told me something about it, and in consequence of that, he took me to the prisoner's, which is in Church-street, I believe—when I went to the prisoner's place, I knocked at the door—I had my brother-in-law alongside of me—the prisoner said, "Come in"—I went in, and he was sitting by the fire—I asked him whether he had bought a quart pot of this boy, showing him my brother-in-law—he denied it—I asked him again, and the boy spoke up, and said, "You did buy it"—I offered the prisoner the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which the boy said he gave him, and then he said he had bought it, but he had taken it home to the landlord's, and put it into the passage—I requested him to go with me to Mr. Mason's, and we all three went together; and I asked Mr. Mason whether the prisoner had brought a quart pot home to him—he said he had not—the prisoner then said he left it in the passage, and then he said he did not, but if Mr. Mason would let him go home, he would get it—Mr. Mason said be would give him the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of his pocket if he would give him his pot, and he would go with him and get it—the prisoner said he could not get it without he went by himself—he was then given into custody.</p>

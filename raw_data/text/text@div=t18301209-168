On the 20th of November I missed this property, and spoke to her - she said she would take me to her brother's to get the things out which she had pawned, but she ran away from me in Gray's Inn-lane; I had missed the sheet, pillows, counterpane, and flat-iron, which had been let to her with the room - they are worth about 12s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not, on the Saturday when I asked you to lend me half a crown, give me leave to take any article out of the room, so that I brought it back again? A. No, I never allowed her to pawn any thing - she said she would pay at 2s. a week; I did not say on the Friday,"Your friend has had a very bad week, and if you will pay 2s. and bring in some of the things, it will do" - I did not know your husband had deserted you; you never asked me to let you stay for 1s. 6d. or 2s. a week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say she did not offer to borrow any money of you? A. Yes - I never allowed her to pawn any of the things; she and her husband lodged with me twelve months before, and one night they came and asked me to take them, and they would pay 2s. a week; they paid the first Saturday, and the next Saturday she said her husband had run away, but I do not know that he did - I saw him go out the first Saturday morning, but I saw him no more.</p>

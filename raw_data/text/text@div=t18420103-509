                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Snow-hill. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening, the 22nd of December, between six and seven o'clock, I was in St. John's-lane, and felt a pull at my great-coat pocket—I turned round, missed my handkerchief, and found the prisoner immediately behind me—I said, "You young rascal, you have taken my handkerchief"—he said, "Me, sir! me, sir!" and jumped into the road—I jumped after him, seized him by the collar, and saw a tall young man running away towards the City—I said to the prisoner, "Come along with me"—he said, "Let go, and I will go along with you"—I let go of him, and after going a few yards, he ran up a court-way—I ran after him, seized him in the court-way, and brought him along into St. John-street—I could not find a po<lb></lb>liceman for a minute or so—some of the crowd said, "Give him a <hi rend="italic">hiding,</hi> and let him off"—I struck him with my hand, and said, "Go about your</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live in Brewer's-street, Somer's-town. I have known the prisoners about four months, by their coming very frequently to the shop for straps—they lived about one street from us, with their mother—their father has left—I missed a pair of half-boots on the afternoon of the 2nd of October—these are them—I know them by being the workmanship of a man employed on the premises, and they are finished by myself—they had not been sold—they were inside, in the window.</p>

On the 2nd of Octo<lb></lb>ber, in the afternoon, about three o'clock, the prisoners came for a pair of straps, to be cut for them—I cut them—they said they had been several times before, and told me the price they paid—I charged them the same—they paid me, and left—they came again in about an hour, for another pair rather shorter—about six o'clock my brother came home, and missed a pair of boy's boots from the side window where Mary Ann, the youngest prisoner, had stood—there had been no persons in the shop but these prisoners, from that time—I said I should know them—my brother desired me to give them into custody—these are the boots that were missed.</p>

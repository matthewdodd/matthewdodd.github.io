                  </hi>. I am a turner, but am at present out of place, and am residing with my parents in Chandos-street—they sell oysters and ginger<lb></lb>beer. On the 13th of January I saw the three prisoners together, in New-street, Covent-garden, between nine and ten o'clock at night—I saw James Geary attempt to pick a gentleman's pocket—William Geary was close behind him—Watson was on the other side of the way—James Geary got the handkerchief from the pocket, and ran down. Bedfordbury—I followed them on to Covent-garden, where I told an officer—he took James Geary, I took William Geary, and another officer took Watson—on the road to the station-house, James Geary attempted to drop the handkerchief—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I do not know what became of the gentleman—I do not know his name—I had seen the prisoners all together for about five minutes before the handkerchief was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I was on duty about a quarter to ten o'clock on Sunday night, the 13th of January, and Hall gave me information—I took the prisoners, who were all together, and on the way James Geary was trying to drop this handkerchief from the tail of his coat—I took him to the station-house and searched him, as I thought minutely, but on the way to the cell, another officer saw another handker<lb></lb>chief drop from his trowsers.</p>

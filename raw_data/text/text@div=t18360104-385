                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Davis. On saturday, the 19th of December, Mr. Brittain brought me twenty-seven <hi rend="italic">weekly Visitors</hi>, which he stated he had brought of Paul—these are the publications—they all bear the date of the 22nd of December—they would be in course of publication by the society, to the trade, on Monday morning—on Monday, the 21st, a mes<lb></lb>sage was sent to Paul's shop, and he came in the evening, between six and eight—Mr. Jones, Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Dix, and myself, were there—I heard all the questions that were put—Mr.Paul was asked to account for selling the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Visitors</hi> on the saturday—he replied, that he had sent a lad to pur<lb></lb>chase two hundred of the preceding week, and that one of the bundles con<lb></lb>tained fifty of that week, and fifty of that succeeding week—he was asked whom he sent to buy them—he replied, "A lad who came into my shop"—being asked what lad, he said, he did not know, but would inquire—he was going away, after about half an hour's interview, and promising to produce the lad, if he could, and throw light on the investigation that he knew was then going on—he was asked where he bought these numbers, but not by me—I was asked if I had any observation to make—I said, "we ought not to request of Mr.Paul to make the inquiry, but to require it of him for no Jury would believe the fact, that he was in the habit of sending boys whom he did not know to purchase his goods"—I said, "We do not want more information than Mr.Paul can at this moment give us no object can therefore be attained by delay;" and, addressing Mr.Paul, I said, "Two things, sir, are certain: the one is, that we have been robbed; the other is, that you have received the goods"—I should say, that during the conversation, Mr. Paul had been reminded that sales of fourteen dosen, twelve dozen, and other sales, could be provided against him; and I asked him, how he could account for such large sales, since he had admitted that he only had fifty by mistake that week, and that such an error had not oc<lb></lb>curred before?—he said, it was impossible—he was asked, in the course of</p>

               <p>the conversation, if he had had any business transactions with Dyson; and he said he had not—this was Monday, the 21st—he went away—I heard nothing more of him till Tuesday, the 29th, when, at about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, he came into the shop, and beckoned me aside—I took him into Mr.Davis's counting-room, and he said, "It is of no use attempting to keep this matter a secret any longer I am come to clear myself, and to show that I have paid for all the goods that I have had"—he then produced these papers, which are marked No. 1 to 10 in the first parcel; and 11 to 26, and this one, which makes twenty-seven—I have seen Dyson write frequently—these are Dyson's hand<lb></lb>writing—I asked Paul if he had received all the goods specified in these papers—he replied that he had, and had paid for them—I asked him, "How?" and he pointed to these two papers (<hi rend="italic">marked C</hi>)—he said he had paid for them in his own shop—On inquiring if he had paid the writer of the invoices, he said he had, on the dates they bear—I asked him if he did not suspect something was wrong—he replied, "Not till yesterday week"—that is the substance of what he said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to tell us whether, supposing he had purchased the different articles specified in these bills of parcels, and paid for them over the counter of the Society's office, he would not have re<lb></lb>ceived a discount of ten per cent.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On such as amounted to above 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would—I searched Dyson's clothes, which were at the warehouse, and found this paper (<hi rend="italic">marked A</hi>) in his waistcoat pocket—there is a me<lb></lb>morandum on it at the bottom, in Dyson's hand-writing—on these invoices (Nos. 1to 27) being produced by Paul, and these two papers, I was pro<lb></lb>ceeding to put them under my coat, and Paul said, "You will not take them?"—I said, "Yes, I must show them to Mr. Jones"—and I gave Paul a memorandum, that he had delivered papers, purporting to be in<lb></lb>voices, into my hands—Mr. Dix was present part of the time during this interview—at the close of the interview, before Paul left, he asked if John Dyson was in sight—I looked through the counting-house window to as<lb></lb>certain—I then turned to him, and said, "The coast is clear"—and Mr. Dix, in my presence, at the same time informed that Dyson was behind the nest of shelves in the library—Dyson had no authority for selling any of the society's publications, and he only made out invoices under another young man, who was in the country department—the prices on this paper (<hi rend="italic">A</hi>) and the casting up, are in Dyson's hand-writing—these invoices are quite irregular, and such as could not come from the Society—they have neither the name of the purchaser, the date, nor receipt: and some of them are not printed, only written; some of them have neither the name of the vendor nor purchaser.</p>

Q.</hi> Between the first and second interview, about one week had elapsed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he came voluntarily the second time—he had a week to abscond after the first interview—there are deductions from some of these bills—in one case a deduction of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on a bill for only six pennyworth of goods—there are prices marked opposite the articles, and they are full prices, with a very few exceptions—on the 29th he objected to my taking these papers till I gave him a memorandum.</p>

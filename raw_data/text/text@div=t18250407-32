               <p>JOHN BRANT. On the night of the 19th of last March, my poultry-house was robbed - I had some malt in that evening, and when I went with the light, to get the malt, into the granary, the poultry made a noise, I looked up and saw they were all safe - there was a cock and seven hens. Next morning, at seven o'clock, I found the brew-house window wrenched open, and all the fowls gone but one hen. I looked up the yard, and found a quantity of blood and feathers - I got a search warrant and found them on the prisoner's premises, about a quarter of a mile from my house; he was sitting by the fire, and the constable said</p>
               <p>"Mr. Brant has had some poultry stolen, and has strong suspicion of you." The prisoner said</p>
               <p>"I know nothing about it," but I saw some feathers on the ground, and said</p>
               <p>"I am confident the fowls are here." The officer then opened the door of a cupboard, and found two of them unpicked. We took him to the cage and then returned and looked into the privy, and found a fowl thrown down which had been picked and trussed ready for the pot. The prisoner said he had found them at ten o'clock the night before. I had given him two days work about three months before, and given him some food and some drink.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are there no fowls like yours in this country.? A. Yes, but these were the spangled Poland breed, and one of them was a brown speckled pullet. I can positively swear to them.</p>

            . I went with Brant to execute the search-warrant on the 20th of March - what he has said is all correct - the prisoner said he knew nothing of the fowls.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming home at night I picked up the two fowls - I shewed them the spot where I found them, and said if they were Mr. Brant's they might take them.</p>

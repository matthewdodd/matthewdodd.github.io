            . I slept in the house by the prosecutrix's desire. I fastened all the doors between ten and eleven o'clock at night, and heard Mrs. Hughes lock the parlour door; every thing was safe then. I saw the clock. I have lived with my master six years, and have seen the clock in his house. I do not know when it was taken to the prosecutrix's. I got up about five o'clock in the morning, and found the kitchen-door open, which I had shut. I went to bed again, finding it was only five o'clock. The watchman rang the bell soon after to know if all was safe. I went up and found the inner-door on the top of the stairs forced open, and a square of glass was taken quite out. Between this and the yard-door is a water-closet - the sash-frame was entirely forced out of the brick-work into the yard; it looked into the yard, and I saw it safe the day before. I missed the clock.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 5th of May, about three minutes past three in the morning, I was in Rochester-row. About the middle of the row is a small bridge, which leads to Vincent-square. I saw three men coming towards me in a direction from the prosecutrix's in the square, about eighty yards from her house; the prisoner was one, and he got behind the wall of an adjoining garden; they were in company together. I have seen them in company many times before, and one of them asked me what o'clock it was - I said you know better than me; they passed me and went into Rochester-row. The moon shone, and it was getting light. I then went towards the wall, and saw the prisoner go from the wall under the railings of the square - he pretended to be looking through the railing. I told Cox and Shields - Cox lifted up his lantern, and by the light of it we found the clock among the bushes, on the very spot where he was looking through. The prisoner was then gone through a little street into Rochester-row - I went into Rochester-row and saw he had joined the other two again. They went through a passage into the fields. I met another with him, and followed them. I went to get some person to prevent them escaping, and on my return I found a watchman in pursuit of the prisoner. Kidd and Evans secured him, the others escaped - he was searched at the watch-house and two small bags found on him, which the prosecutrix claimed. I am certain he is the man who hid himself behind the wall, and went to the spot where the clock was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was quite daylight - A. It was getting daylight. The clock was within the palisades opposite another house.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Vincent-square, on the opposite side to Hughes's house. On the 5th of May, as I was calling three o'clock, Wilton came and asked me if I had seen three men? I said No. He said there had been robbery near my beat. I went to the corner by the shrubbery, I threw my lanthorn in to hide it, and saw the face of the clock inside the shrubbery paling - it struck three as I took it into my hand - I got it over the railing. I left it at the watch-house after the prisoner was taken. I went round to the house, and found it belonged to Hughes. I alarmed the apprentice - I found a desk was gone, and saw it laying on a flower-bed in the next garden. Some writings, a medal, and about twelve keys were on the flower-bed - the desk was open. The garden was very much trampled - more persons than one had been there. A person must pass through this garden to get to the prosecutrix's water-closet.</p>

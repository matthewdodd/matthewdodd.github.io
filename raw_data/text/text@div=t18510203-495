On 16th Jan., between seven and eight o'clock, I was crossing the Whitmore-road, and saw Clark—the prisoner went behind her, put his band over the girl's right shoulder, and snatched the paper—as he turned, I saw his face by the light of a shop—he dropped five collars and got away—I have seen him before, and swear he is the man—I have beard persons call him Field—he was dressed in a brown round coat, and a cap—I saw him at the station—the constable asked his name, and he gave Frederick Field.</p>

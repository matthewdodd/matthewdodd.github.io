               <p>our employ—on Friday 12th May we were to receive twenty-five quarters of malt in fifty sacks, from Mr. Jupp—Finch came with it—he was in Mr. Jupp's service, the malster—he brought this receipt and delivery not after, as I supposed the malt was delivered—Finch and Gosbell came into the counting-house—I asked Finch whether he had delivered twenty-five quarter—he said, "Yes"—I asked Gosbell whether he had received twenty-five quar<lb></lb>ters—he said, "Yes"—I then signed the receipt note and gave it to Finch—I afterwards received a communication from Newton, went into the granary and counted the sacks; there were but forty-six—I then followed the prisoners and found them in a public house—I asked Finch what he had got in his wagon, he said, two quarters of malt—he said, he hoped he had not done wrong and should not get himself into a scrape, but our man Gosbell ordered him to take them somewhere else—I told him to draw round—Gosbell went into the biewery—I sent for an officer and took him—he came—I asked him how it was—he said he thought the whole twenty-five quarters were delivered.</p>

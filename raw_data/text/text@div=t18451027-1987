The prisoner was in my service as a labourer—I employed him at No. 25, Lower Northampton-street—I had the articles stated at that house, and saw them safe on Sunday, the 7th of Oct.—I had seen the prisoner there on the Saturday previous—I missed the articles on the fol<lb></lb>lowing Thursday—they have not been found—the prisoner ought to have been at work there, but was not—I afterwards found him at Deptford, and had him apprehended.</p>

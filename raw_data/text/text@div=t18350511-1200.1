                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live in Black-horse-fields, at Haggerston, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. On the evening of the 20th of April, I left my house with my wife, about seven o'clock—I left nobody in the house—I returned about half-past eight o'clock, and heard my dog bark—I found my gate fastened, but my window opened, and a light in my room on the ground floor—I got along the rails by the ditch, looked into the room, and saw the prisoner searching my drawers all over, going from one drawer to another—I had left the house locked up and closed—my wife had locked it up, but not in my presence—I found the street-door and yard-door locked when I returned, and I am sure the window was down when I went out—I got over the pales—he was so busily engaged he did not observe me—I got to the window, looked at him for some minutes, and then said, "What do you do here?" with that he blew the candle out; and I said, "You had better come out, it is of no use stopping there"—he made a rush all in a moment to come out—I had seen him putting things into one pocket and another pocket before the candle</p>

               <p>was put out—he blow the candle out when I spoke to him, and made a rush out of the window—I caught hold of him; he resitted a little, he kicked and pinched me several times—I said, "It is of no use"—he could not get from me—he tried to get over the palings, but I pulled him back again—I kept him there, and called the police—he was feeling in one pocket and another, but what he was doing I could not tell at the time, but found he was <hi rend="italic">chucking</hi> the things out of his pocket—I found thrown about where we had been scuffling, my watch-guard, which was broken, also a diamond pin and brooch—I called the police—Reeves came and jumped over the gate, he took the keys out of my pocket, and let in the policeman—I had the keys of the gate and the door in my pocket—they remained locked—the police<lb></lb>man and Reeves went into the house—I followed them in; when they struck a light, I found my things all strewed about—a shawl and tippet laid on the carpet—I had left that shawl on a chair when I left—he was taken to the station-house—a chisel and hat, which did not belong to me, were found inside the house—the value of all the articles is not 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was not quite dark when I left home—I could see a man's face by the light of day at that time—it was not candle-light when I left the house.</p>

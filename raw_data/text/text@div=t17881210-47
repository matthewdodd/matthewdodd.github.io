               <p>Was you in the shop? - I was engaged with five or six customers at the time the apprentice came up to me, and said there was a woman in the shop that he suspected had pilfered something; I said, do not let her go out of the shop, but take it from her, if she has any thing; with that the woman was just coming out of the shop, opposite to me, and made me a very low curtsey, and bade me good night; the boy said this is the woman; I stamped with my foot, and said, why do not you take the goods from her; with that the boy went up to her, and followed her out, but still did not take the goods from her; I jumped over the counter, and went out after them; I met the boy in the doorway, she was with him; he had hold of her shoulder; I laid hold of the prisoner, and saw her drop a piece of printed cotton, and I took it up; I felt it drop on my foot.</p>
               <p>Did you see her drop it? - I saw her drop it from under her left arm; I stooped and picked it up, and delivered it to the constable, who has it; the piece was the same I saw her drop; when she came back into the shop, she kneeled down, and begged forgiveness.</p>
               <p>What was become of the other young woman that came into the shop with her? - She was gone off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's council. How many persons were there in the shop at the time this happened? - I think as near as I can guess, half a score customers, and about six young men behind the counter.</p>
               <p>You, of your own knowledge, had not observed any thing till your boy gave you notice? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was taken into another room and searched? - No, she never was searched; she was taken into my warehouse till the constable was sent for; I had found the goods before she was taken there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Let the boy go out for a moment. You did not know the prisoner before? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Therefore the boy could not direct you to her by any name; what description did he give you of her; did he tell you the woman in red hair? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Was not there, in truth, another woman in the shop at the time in red hair? - I do not know, indeed.</p>
               <p>Do you know now that another person in the shop had red hair? - There were a great many other persons in the shop.</p>
               <p>None of whom are here? - Nobody is here but the boy.</p>

               <p>I was standing in the shop lighting the lamps, when the prisoner and another person came in; there was a large pile of prints about two yards from her, and she moved on the other side of the pile of prints; I did not see any thing that was done, for the prints hindered me; but when I had done lighting the lamps, I missed a particular piece of print which laid there single by itself, about eight minutes before; I told my master I thought that woman had something with her; he told me to follow her; I rather refused, I was not sure; I did not like to go; he was angry, and I was obliged to go; I followed her, and brought her back to the door, and there she dropped a piece of print by his foot, and he picked it up; that particular print lay by itself under a pile of prints.</p>
               <p>Did you see her drop it? - No, I did not, distinctly; my master had hold of her.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take it? - No, I could not see her take it, for the prints prevented me seeing her.</p>
               <p>How many of your own people were there in the shop? - About five or six who served customers.</p>

In April, 1837, I went to lodge at No. 1, Dolphin-place—I did not know the deceased by name—I know an old woman lived in the house—I saw her the night she was brought there, which was about a month or six weeks after the time I went to live there—I saw her in the passage with Mrs. Marriott—she occupied the back parlour of the house No. 2—I should say she occupied it not more than three weeks or a month at the most—after leaving the back parlour, she went into the front kitchen—I was in it the day it was prepared for her reception—there was furniture brought the night she came—she was brought to No. 1 at first—that was the night the furniture was brought—I do not know How much furni<lb></lb>ture there was—I believe some part of it was sold—I have seen the pri<lb></lb>soner cleaning up furniture for sale—I do not know whether that was part of the furniture that was brought in for her—I did not see furniture at all—it was brought in the night—there was no furniture is the kitchen subsequent to the day I saw it—I cannot say whether she went into it that night or the next day—Mrs. Marriott said it was being prepared for her reception—I saw her in it the same week—I never heard the prisoner or his wife talking to Mrs. Warner—I never heard her name till after her death—I left on the 14th, and she died on the 19th—I used to ask after her as the old lady—he and his wife used to tell me repeatedly that she was well, and better than I was—I lived there from April till the 14th of February this year—at the time I left the old lady was alive—the servant has been standing at the door, and Mrs. Warner has walked about Dolphin-place, and talked to me—for five months before her death I never saw her out of her room—I have spoken to her in the kitchen before Mrs. Marriott—about the middle of October, I was sitting in the parlour occupied by Mrs. Robinson, in the house No. 1—there came repeated knocks at the door for Mr. Marriot—they were not answered by him—be was not in the house at the time, nor his wife—we went to the door, and I went with Mrs. Godwin—Mrs. Warner was screaming "Murder," and trying to get out—the entrance to the kitchen is from the area of the house No. 1, over a sink—you might go from the house No. 2—when I heard the scream, Mrs. Robinson and Mrs. Godwin went through to the door, out of the area, with a candle—I staid above—I went to the gate to try and find a policeman <hi rend="italic">to come</hi>, but I could not see one—the old lady came to the window—she said that she had got out of bed and could not get in again; and she wanted to get away from there—there was no fire in the room, and she had no light, and it was about half-past eight o'clock at night—she said they had got her clothes—she did not mention names—she said they had got her clothes and furniture—all she seemed to want was to get away—I was absent part of the time while Mrs. Robinson was holding the light—I have spoken to the prisoner about the old lady—I was cleaning a few knives and forks once, and the servant came and locked the door of the kitchen, and jumped over the place where I was standing, which is where the sink is where</p>

We live at No. 1, Dolphin-court—we were both living thereat the time the old lady in question was living there—we went to live there on the 1st of August last—at that time I believe Mrs. Warner was living in the kitchen—on one occasion Mrs. Godwin mentioned something to me—in consequence of that I went to the kitchen window, where Mrs. Warner was—she was calling murder, and shaking the door violently—I desired Mrs. Godwin to fetch a policeman—I said to Mrs. Warner, "Has any one a key that will open the door?"—I endeavoured to pacify her—she said, "They have got me here, and all my good clothes and things; and see here, look at this Place, when I have got so much good furniture of my own"—I did not Particularly notice How the place was furnished, but it did not appear com<lb></lb>fortable—I was looking through the window—I put a candle through a square of glass that was out—(this was in the month of October)—there was no means of closing the square—it appeared taken out of the frame—I said,</p>

I know the house in Dolphin-place—I knew it from April, last year, down to February in this year—I attended to the lodgers, and worked for two ladies in the house, No. 2, in which Mrs. Warner lived—she lived in the kitchen, and in the parlour, at first—I was never in the parlour while she was there—I remember her living in the kitchen—I once or twice heard her making a noise, and she told me to let her out, and said it was very cold—I asked her if she had any fire, and she said she had no fire, she had only had fire twice while she was there—she told me this about December or January—when I was talking to her the weather was cold—it was that induced me to ask her—I was out<lb></lb>side the room—I could not get in then—I did get in once—the door was locked—she told me there was no fire—I was not able to see that myself—I looked through the window once in the cold weather, and there was no fire—I saw a screen; that was standing so as to prevent a view of the fire-place—it was something like a shutter—it was before the fire-place—I could not see the grate—I did not see into the room when she said she had no fire—when I spoke to her it was through the key-hole—it was a kind of wooden screen—it was close to the grate, to the best of my knowledge—it was not as a cloak to the chimney, but a cloak to the grate—it was close against the grate, so that I could not see it—I cannot tell whether it was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, residing at No. 90, High-Holborn. on the evening of the 26th of February last, I went to the kitchen of the house, No. 2, Dolphin-place, and found the dead body of a female lying in a coffin—I looked at the body, and then returned to the Coroner's jury—I subsequently made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—on the view I had of it first it presented an appearance of great emaciation, as if she had died from some lingering disease, or from starvation—on the same day I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the immediate cause of death was water on the brain—I cannot tell what that was produced by—it might have been the cones<lb></lb>quence of disease, but I found no disease except water in the centre of the brain—that is sometimes the effect of inflammation in younger subjects, and dometimes the effect of great exhaustion—it may be caused by some dis<lb></lb>ease or by extreme exhaustion—we call inflammation disease—any thing may produce inflammation of the brain may produce effusion of water on the brain—I found no disease in the brain sufficient to produce this water—there was only a very slight appearance of inflammation of the mem<lb></lb>branes, or what I should call lymph, thrown up on the membranes of the brain which is sometimes, I believe, present without inflammation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If it does not arise from inflammation, to what other cause can you attribute the appearances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To great exhaustion—or excitement may pro<lb></lb>duce it also—it is my opinion that there was no disease apparent that could cause this—there was very great emaciation of the body, and the stomach and bowels were empty, and were collapsed—the heart also was empty, that is, there was a very small quantity of blood in it, not the quantity we usally find in <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What in your opinion did that emaciation arise from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is im<lb></lb>Possible to answer that question decidedly—it might arise from a want of a proper quantity of food—I am not aware of any thing else—we see that emaciation, when death happens, from diseased lungs; but here the lungs were healthy—water in the brain may be called a disease, but it is more the effect of disease.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose by emaciation you mean there was scarcely any flesh to the body, but the skin adhering to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; as complete a state of emaciation as ever I saw, as if in the last stage of consumption—that is not often the case with old persons, unless they have some organic disease—if there was an effusion of water on the brain, produced by exhaustion, there might not be some appearance of effusion of water in other parts—I will not swear there would not be—ex<lb></lb>citement is usually followed by great exhaustion—I am quite certain death was caused by water on the brain—I am not quite certain that water on the brain must have been produced by exhaustion—by exhaustion, I mean that state of collapse which you see after great excitement—I may explain further, by saying, when a person has lost a large quantity of blood, that will produce exhaustion and death, a diminished supply of blood not sufficient to support life—emptiness of the intestines might probably be produced by other causes than withholding food—I found no cause on examination sufficient to account for the emptness of the stomach—vomit<lb></lb>ing for some time before death may account for it, or other causes—there are cases of disease, for instance, stricture in the throat; but that would be visible—I never met in my practice a case in which water in the brain was produced by want of food—I never read in the course of my medical educa<lb></lb>tion any case to that effect.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MBALLANTJNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your experience, you never met with a per<lb></lb>son starved to death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—the appearances on all parts of the body betokened the want of proper food and nourishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell us whether the state of the body did or did not betoken an incapacity to derive nourishment from food? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No it did not—I found no disease—that is the only thing that would incapa<lb></lb>citate the person who had food offered to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>.. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the appearance of the stomach could the person have taken any food within a reasonable time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not within some hours previous to death—I should say twelve hours—I saw the body in the kitchen—there were no marks of vomiting pointed out to me—she had been dead a week when I examined her.</p>

I remember the prisoner at the bar, coming to my house, about eight o'clock in the evening of the day in the indictment; he asked for a glass of porter; he said would I grant him a favour; I told him I must know what it was before I said I would. He said it was but a small one, he wanted to give a child a three shilling piece, and would I give him one for small silver; I said yes, and he gave me two shillings, and two sixpences, and I lighted a candle, and looked at them, and they were perfectly good. I put them into the till; I gave him a three shilling piece out of the till. I took the candle in one hand, and the money in the other, and told him to look at it, and see that it was good. I know that the three shilling piece I gave him was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290040"></xptr>full cheek, and it also had a little half moon on it; I took very particular notice of it, for I would not have given it to him if I had had another. He had another three shilling piece under his fingers, and as I was going to look at it, he put his hand over it. He went away, and he was back in an instant, and said, I don't much like this, mistress, and I will thank you to change it. He held it towards me, and I perceived it was not the one I gave him. I called him a rascal, and told him, I had a great mind to knock him down I snatched both out of his hand, and said, he should not have either until he had been before his betters. I sent for a constable to apprehend him, and as soon as he found the constable was sent for, he left the house, though it rained very hard.</p>

            . I followed the prisoner, and took him. He pretended he was going back to the place where he had taken the three shilling piece, and on account of his agitation, I was about to take him into custody, when he ran away. I overtook him, and he put up both his fists, but I told him that if he would strike, I would strike; with that, I knocked him down, and secured him.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole belonging to Sir Sampson Wright. On the 4th of November, in the evening, about seven o'clock, I was on the Kilburn road; I met with the two prisoners at the bar; they were coming towards town; I suppose this might be three miles from Mutter's house; I stopped them, and asked Dickeman what he had there? he said, ducks, and had bought them at Kensington; I said, this is not the way from Kensington; I found four ducks on him; he said he bought them out of a country cart; I took them into custody, and placed them in the watch-house; there were sixteen snares for catching hares, and a brass candlestick, found on Dickeman.</p>
               <p>- BAKER sworn.</p>
               <p>Deposed to the same effect, only that he understood Dickeman to have said he bought them at Kilburn, instead of Kensington.</p>

               <p>I was coming along the road, and met a man with a basket of ducks; this young man bought four ducks for four and sixpence and a pot of beer; I came up behind, and bought the other four.</p>
               <p>Cridland. On my return, I took them into a new public-house; he never pointed out any person of whom they bought them.</p>

               <p>I bought the four at Kensington.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went up to him the second time, did he not say, now, sir, I have it? - A. No, he did not; I took it from him before he could have time to say a single word; after I had taken it from him, he said so.</p>
               <p>Q. You seized him so instantaneously, that he had no time to speak? - A. Yes.</p>

I instantly replied, no, I am not a man of that description; I had my cane in my right-hand, and nothing in my left-hand; Mr. Murray took my coat, opened it, and looked inside, but found nothing, he seemed confused, and going along between Mr. Child's, the banker's, and Temple-lane, I picked up the pocket book, before I could turn round to shew it, or offer it, to Mr. Murray, I was seized instantaneously, so much so, that I had the book forced up against me in the manner Mr. Murray has described; he said, you have got my pocket-book, I said, yes, I have, I have picked it up; Mr. Murray would not have gone any further in it, but Mr. Dawson would have me taken to Bow-street; going along in the coach, he said, we shall soon do his business for him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Murray.) Did you see the prisoner stoop at any time? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who had known him from three to twenty years, and gave him an excellent character.</p>

Last Saturday night, at a quarter past eleven o'clock, I was in the New-road; I had received my pay, but was not in the least in liquor - the prisoner ran up against me, and I asked her what she did it for; she then asked me to give her something to drink, and we went to the Globe public-house, but could not get in - we then went down <placeName id="t18261207-135-crimeloc796">Church-street</placeName>

I said, "No, but I have lost something else;" I missed two sovereigns and a half from my waistcoat pocket; I said, "You have robbed me of two sovereigns and a half;" she said, "No - I have not a farthing about me;" she then threw herself down on some steps, pulled both her stockings off, and some half-pence fell out, but nothing else; she was then walking on, and some more half-pence fell from her; I then saw her attempt to put her hand into her bosom, but I clasped her hands, and said I would take her to the watch-house - she said she would go, and I gave her to the watchman - we then went on, and a sovereign dropped before us in the watch-house - the constable searched her; I heard a sovereign fall from her after that, and saw her take the half-sovereign from her mouth.</p>

            . I am the constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, and a sovereign fell from her - I then searched her in the back room, and another sovereign fell from her - she then gave me a half-sovereign, but I did not see where she took it from - there were 8s. or 9s. in silver found on her - she affected a great deal of delicacy, which was the reason of my taking her into the back room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I live with a clergyman in Lisson-grove - my mistress had given me 4l. - I got a little intoxicated, and was counting my money when the prosecutor came up, and said, if I did not give him two sovereigns, he would take me to the watch-house; I had 3l. 10s. 6d. when I was taken.</p>

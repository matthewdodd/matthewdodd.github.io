                  </hi> In March last I kept the Red Lion, in King edward-street, St. Martin's-le-Grand. My family consisted of three little children of my sister's, one maid-servant the prisoner Jane Walker, one man-servant, named William Roberts, and a person named Birchnall, who assisted me at the bar—I had a black box in my bed-rom, which contained six silver table-spoons, two desert and eleven tea-spoons, four salt-ladles, one pair of sugar-tongs, some forks, a silver watch, chain nd seal, four rings, a brooch a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, a promissory-note for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a stock receipt for 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the plate and jewellery were on a tray in the box, and the money and notes in a work-box under that tray—on 20th March I had two charwomen at the house, Hannah Shepherd and Mary Smith, the wife of Samuel Smith, of Philpot-street, Commercial-road, I believe—I had one lodger, named Hambridge—a person named Baker was there, as a customer—a great many persons came in as customers, but no other persons were living there besides those I have named—Mr. M'Millan was there that day, assisting me in the business, as I did not understand it—about seven o'clock, on 20th March, I sent Walker and Mrs. Smith to my bed-room, which is No. 1, to make the bed—the box was in that room—I had been in the room a very short time before, and the box was then safe—I afterwards sent them up to the top of the house, to remove a large old linen-press, which I wanted brought down—they would have to pass my bed-room in going up, but would not have to bring it down so far—one of the children slept with me, and the other two in No. 3, on the same floor, where the maid-servant slept—there were two beds in that room—about nine o'clock, in consequence of information from Birchnall, I went up stairs, and foud the box had been broken open—some of the things were strewed on the floor, and I missed the articles I have stated—there was a quantity of tallow grease on the box, as if the candle grease had been dropped on it—the two women would have had a candle when they went up—Walker has been with me since 26th Jan., but was with my late sister from 4th Nov.—she was in the habit of going to my bed-room when anything was required to</p>

I had received six half year's dividends at the bank on 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock, which amounted to 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the warrant (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is signed by myself—I received the money for it from a cashier at the Bank of England, one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, and the rest in gold—I know the number of the notes—I placed them in that box—they were taken out of the box when it was broken open—I did not write my name on the notes.</p>

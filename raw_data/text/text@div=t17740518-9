            . I am a constable; on the 13th of this month, about three in the afternoon, coming out of the Old Change, I saw the prisoners picking pockets in Cheapside; knowing the biggest to be very notorious, I followed them, and watched them half an hour; I saw them attempt several gentlemen's pockets; I watched them till they came to the end of Queen-street; there they both stopped about five minutes; I crossed the way and stood opposite to them; the prosecutor came by the end of Queen-street, and crossed the way to St. Mildred's church, in the Poultry, and they followed him to the back of the Sun Fire Office, opposite the Bank; there I saw Morley put his hand in the gentleman's pocket; he had attempted it several times; he took the handkerchief out of his pocket, and put it under the right hand side of his coat; I ran up to him, catched him fast by the collar, and called to the gentleman; I borrowed a coachman's whip and took the handkerchief out of the area myself. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to.)</p>

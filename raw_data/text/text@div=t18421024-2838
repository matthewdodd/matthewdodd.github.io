                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Sir Ralph Howard, Bart. On the 29th of September, there were ninety-one ewes, five lambs, and a ram, safe in a meadow belonging to Sir Ralph, in the parish of Little Stanmore—I did not count them myself—on the morning of the 30th, I went with the shepherd to the meadow, in consequence of what he said to me, and in the ditch near the gate of the field I saw a mark of blood—I afterwards saw in a ditch on the other side of the hedge, part of a ewe sheep, the hind legs, the loin, and shoulder had been taken away—the skin was left, it had not been slaughtered in the way a butcher would have killed it—the entrails had been ruptured, and the contents of the entrails had ran about the meat—I traced some foot-marks—on the following Sunday I saw the super<lb></lb>intendent of police with a pair of high shoes, the left shoe had a little cow<lb></lb>dung on it—among the impressions of the shoes was one on a seat of cow-dung—I saw the shoe brought by an officer compared with the place on the cow-dung—it corresponded, and there was a little cow-dung removed from the seat—we took the remainder of the mutton and the skin away—it appeared to be about three yards from the place where the sheep was killed, and thrown over a hedge—the skin and entrails were on the other side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shepherd to Sir Ralph Howard. I counted the sheep on the 28th, there were ninety-one ewes, five lambs, and a ram, I passed them through the gate—about ten o'clock the following morning I passed them through a gate and counted them, and missed one ewe—I saw the other sheep go and peep into the ditch—I went and looked, and found blood—I told Mr. Knight—I saw the shoe fitted in the cow-dung—it fitted very well—I found the skin and the head of the sheep—I did not know it again—it appeared slaughtered in a very clumsy manner—the en<lb></lb>trails had burst, and were scattered about the liver—I should think it had been killed about twelve hours—one of the hurdles had been taken from its place, and put across the ditch, to keep them from running through—the head of the hurdle was very bloody—I believe that sheep to have been my master's.</p>

On Sunday the 2nd I went to the prisoner's house at Clay-hill, Bushy, nearly two miles from Little Stan<lb></lb>more, with Snowling, the officer—I found the prisoner, his wife, and three children, just set down to dinner—they had a pie on the table—I asked the prisoner what the pie consisted of—he said, mutton, beef, and odd pieces of pork, and things, that he had bought at Watford-market, about half-past seven o'clock the night before—I examined the pie—there was no beef or pork in it—it consisted of part of a leg of mutton, and part of the loin—I said I should search his house to see if there was any more mutton—he saw me going towards a basket, and said, "You will find a bit there, under some linen"—I lifted up the clothes, and found a small part of a leg of mutton, with a stain on it, as though from the bruised en<lb></lb>trails</p>

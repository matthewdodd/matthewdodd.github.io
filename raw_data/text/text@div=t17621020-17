I went to Kingston to the sister's mistress; she was called into the parlour; I asked her with respect to parcels sent her by her brother; and upon examination found she had got several things with our own marks upon them, which I can swear to, and several not marked, which I have great reason to believe are our own property.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention the things you can swear to.</p>
               <p>[The goods produced in court.]</p>
               <p>Viney. Here is a piece of Holland, two pieces of Irish, two pieces of cheque linen, two pieces of cotton, two pieces of muslin, and twelve handkerchiefs. I returned to London, and took out a warrant against the prisoner and searched his box, and in it we found several things, some with our marks on them, some not, [ produced in court]; then we took him before Justice Welch, there he confessed to the taking those things; he was asked at what times he took them; he said, he having the key to open the shop, used to take them early in the morning, before the journeymen came down, and that he had embraced such opportunities for three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a servant in your house?</p>
               <p>Viney. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he acknowledge he sent these to his sister which you found there?</p>
               <p>Viney. He did; and said, he sent them by one Cook, a waterman, and sometimes by the coach, at different times.</p>

               <p>What I sent to Kingston was my own.</p>

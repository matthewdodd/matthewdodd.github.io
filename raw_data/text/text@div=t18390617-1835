                  </hi>. I live with my grandmother in Clerkenwell. On the 26th of May, about eleven o'clock at night, I was in Fleet-street—I saw the prisoner following a gentleman, and saw him touch the gentleman's pocket—I did not see him take the handkerchief out, but I saw him throw it into a doorway, directly the officer went after him—there were three of them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you never said that you saw the prisoner draw a white silk handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I said to-day that I did not see him take it, more out of compassion to him than any thing else—the officer saw him throw it into a doorway—I did not go after the gentleman—I went after the prisoner—I told the policeman, and he took him.</p>

I saw the prisoner loitering up and down Fleet-street, attempting several gentlemen's pockets in company with two others—I watched him some time, and when he saw I noticed him, he ran across the road—I ran after him—he threw the hand<lb></lb>kerchief into the doorway of No. 167, Fleet-street.</p>

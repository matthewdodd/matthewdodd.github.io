On the 6th of March my servant went down stairs and found my house was broke open; he immediately came and told me of it: this was about six in the morning. I found it as he had said, I went into my study, and found all my drawers taken out. There were several mourning rings, medals, and things missing. I mist two silver spoons and two silver salts from out of the parlour, and one silver spoon from out of the pantry. I mist also a tea spoon. I thought this must have been done by a workman. I suspected the prisoner, and upon inquiring, found he had been seen with a great deal of money, gold pieces, and medals that he knew nothing of the value of. I applied to Sir

I asked him concerning the trunk at her house, he said he knew nothing of it, but that it was given him by a journeyman carpenter, whom he did not know where to find. I went back, and got a warrant from the bench of justices at St. Margaret's Hill, and opened the trunk, in the presence of Crisp the constable. I found in it three silver table spoons, two of them with crests, and one with no mark. The rings with the mottoes on them, and a bag of medals, such as I had lost.

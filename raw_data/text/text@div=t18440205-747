                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Francis Tucker and others. On Wednesday, the 10th of Jan., in consequence of suspicion, I saw all the sperm and wax ends and scrapings that I had in stock, weighed, about two o'clock—Murrell and Tarrant were in attendance on me in so doing—the weight of the whole was 471lbs. 8ozs., and there appeared by the shop cash-book 13ozs. of scrapings bought that afternoon, which would make the whole weight 472lbs. 5ozs.—I used all the precaution in my power to ascertain the exact quantity—next day, the 11th, about ten ruinates to five o'clock, I gave directions to Shaw, the policeman, and I put three sovereigns and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; worth of shillings, all marked, into the till—there is a well in the till under where the money is kept loose, in which there is a bag with other gold in it—I do not see any entry made in the book by the prisoner on the 10th of Jan.—this entry of 13ozs. is by Tarrant—on the 11th of Jan., about half-past five, I found the prisoner had entered in the shop cash-book as having paid 13lbs. 8ozs. 8 drachms of wax ends 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, 4lbs. of sperm 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and dripping 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making in the whole 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I directly called in the policeman, and took him into the counting-house—I called in the prisoner, and said, "Sar<lb></lb>geant, here is an entry I don't exactly understand, when did you buy these things?"—he hesitated, and at length said, "In the morning at eleven o'clock"—I said, "That answer does not satisfy me, I have strong doubts as to your integrity, will you show me the contents of your pockets?"—he threw a lea<lb></lb>thern purse on the desk—I said, "You have more money about you than this"—he then placed his hands in his pocket, and put on the desk a quantity of silver, I believe all in shillings—I found amongst them eight of the shil<lb></lb>lings which I had marked on the Wednesday and put them into the till on the Thursday at ten minutes past five during his absence, and this conversation took place about a quarter before six o'clock—I gave him in charge—I said to him, "To save me the trouble of weighing the stock again, the weight of which I know perfectly well, will you tell me where the things are that you say you bought?"—he replied, "You seem to know all about it; I don't say"—the policeman said, "You need answer no questions, but do you choose to account for having the marked money upon you?"—he replied, "I don't say"—I omitted to state that when I discovered the marked silver amongst his money I could not discover the marked sovereign—I had put three marked sovereigns into the till, and only two of them remained—one of them was gone—I then sent for the bag which was placed in the well of the till, and in that bag I found the marked sovereign—the prisoner was then taken to the station, and I proceeded to weigh the wax ends and other things, and allowing for the 13ozs. being added to it, the real increase was 3ozs., allowing for the turn of the scale—it was quite impossible that I that morning at ten minutes to ten o'clock, and the prisoner was engaged in my presence from about ten minutes to eleven till twenty-five minutes to twelve, and in that time he made no purchase of wax ends, or scrapings, or dripping—he never left the counting-house—I was engaged in an interview with a gentleman in a small place that adjoins the counting-house—while the prisoner was not engaged with me he was with Mr. Harrison in the counting-house—I can un<lb></lb>dertake to say that from ten minutes to eleven till twenty-five minutes to twelve o'clock he-was not out of the counting-house.</p>

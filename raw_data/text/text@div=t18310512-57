On the morning of the 28th of April she awoke me at an early hour, by taking my trousers from under my head, where I had placed them over night; I missed a sovereign from the pocket, which I had seen safe when I laid out some money the evening before - I had gone to bed about eleven o'clock; she left the room immediately after the trousers were drawn from under my head - I went after her, and found her in a gin-shop with some low characters; the officer found 8s. 6d. on her - I wish to do her no injury, but to bring her to repentance.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PETCH. I am a superintendent of the watch. On the morning of the 28th of April, at a quarter before four o'clock, I was near the corner of Sun-street, and saw the prisoner coming towards me - she was in company with a man, and appeared to me to say she should not go with him that distance for the small quantity of liquor he had given her; she then came towards me, and said she would not go with him while she had that in her hand, and produced a sovereign; I thought it was copper, but she showed it to me again, and I saw it was good - she said she had plenty more at home, and she went skipping towards Spital-square; she told me she lived in Long-alley - I said that was a long place; she then said it was in Maxwell's-buildings - I saw her father about half-past six o'clock, and took her at the Phoenix wine-vaults: the place I saw her at is two or three hundred yards from her father's - she had 8s. 4d. when she was taken.</p>

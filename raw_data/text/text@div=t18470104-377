He never works at home—he usually comes home about dusk, between six and seven o'clock, except on Saturday nights, when he is later—we were both acquainted with the prisoner—he was in the habit of coming to see us—on Saturday evening, the 14th of Nov., he came to the cottage, between five and six o'clock—it was dusk—my husband was not at home—our cottage is lonely—he tapped at the window—I said, "Who is there?"—he said, "It is me"—I knew his voice well, and opened the door, and said to him, "Are you alone?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Is anything the matter?" seeing him alone, (as he never came to our house, except the night before, without a person I thought was his wife)—he said, "No"—he came in, and said, "I came to ask if you had such a thing as a bit of paint to give me?"—I said, "I have not such a thing in the house"—he put his back to the door—I did not ask him in, as I wondered at seeing him alone, but he stepped in on the mat, asked me for the paint, put his back against the street door, and pushed it to, and it fastened—he kept rubbing his hands—he said he had been putting a bit of wood up at home, and wanted to colour it—he walked into my sitting-room, which is the next room, and said, "I have been over to Newington again, "(he had said on Thursday that he had been to Newington,) to pay the interest on some pledges, as he had not money enough on Friday, and was obliged to again—I said, "Why did you not say so when here yes<lb></lb>terday? I would have given you enough to save you the journey that night"—he said, "I was too tried"—"I said, "Will you like to sit down and take a pipe?" as my husband and he often smoked together—he said, "Thank you", and I gave him a pipe and tobacco—after he had smoked a short time, I was putting some meat into the pot on the fire, which I had just brought in for my husband's supper, having my things on—he said, "You will not have your husband's supper ready"—I shall, it is not more than six o'clock; I do not expect him till between eight and nine"—he said, "You have got your things on, I am keeping you"—I said, It does not matter for a quarter of an hour or so, while you rest"—I was then putting the meat into the pot on the fire—it was necessary to turn round to do so, which I did—he stood close to me; and when I rose up my head after doing so, he was standing close to me; with his hands in his trowsers pocket, and a pipe in his mouth—my eye caught his, and he gave me a dreadful look, which I could not understand—I became quite flurried, and turned back about two steps to<lb></lb>wards the window—I heard his step behind me, and received a most tremendous blow on the top of my head—I was half round the table at that time—he fol<lb></lb>lowed me round the table—I had a light burning on the table—the first thing I observed after he followed me was a tremendous blow on my head, and the light went out at the same moment—the blow was from some substance—I should not think it was a fist—he never spoke—I screamed, "Murder!" and made</p>

               <p>to the front door as well as I could, and before I could get more than half a yard I received another blow—I then got to the front door—I received another blow before that—I then tried to get my hand on the latch to open the door—he turned me from the door, and pushed me into the corner of the room by the window, and there repeated the blows, I cannot say how many times—after striking me a great many times, he caught hold of me, and tore my bonnet off, and tried to tear my throat open—I thought I was struggling for my life, and seized him by his head, thinking it was the last struggle—I held his head under my arm, by the hair, and got to the door—I was sensible enough to know I had his head under my arm—I was crying "Murder!" all the time, and when I got the door open my cries were heard —I kept my feet for a few yards after I got out of the door, and then was caught in the arms of a witness—I was afterwards attended by a surgeon—the prisoner was taken, and brought to me towards morning, and I knew him directly—when he called on the Friday asked me what sort of Christmas I thought I should pass—I said, "I do row; my husband is going home to see his friends, and I must spend mine after he comes back; he has a father and mother in the country"—he said, "That will be expensive"—I said, "Yes; I dare say it will cost 5<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> or 6<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>; it seems a pity to spend money in that way that is hard earned, but he is a very solid man, and does not spend money"—about a month or more ago I had a conversation with him about a robbery in the cottage of Gilbert, whom he knew well—I was speaking about their being robbed while we were both out—he said, "It was a good thing they did not rob your house"—I said, "If they had broken into my place they could not have taken anything but clothes, as what money I have I always carry about me"—he said, "It is a wonder you carry it about you, there are so many robberies"—I said, "Well, I always do, and it would not be taken from me without my life"—I never had any quarrel with the prisoner—I have occasionally lent him money of my husband's, a sovereign at a time—the prisoner never spoke a word from beginning to end during his attack on me—I bled a good deal, and was wounded.</p>

On the 14th of November I was at home—it was very dark—at six o'clock, while I was sitting in my cottage, I heard a sort of stifled shriek, which after<lb></lb>wards broke out into a women's scream—I did not hear anything but scream<lb></lb>ing—I was too far to hear words—I went out directly in the direction in which I heard the screams—I ran against the prosecutrix, pushed her down,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184701040035"></xptr>
               <p>but caught hold of her and prevented her going to the ground—we were run<lb></lb>ning in opposite directions—I found her bleeding, and said, "Who is it?"—she did not seem sensible enough to answer, but kept calling out "Murder"—she was covered with blood, her neck, bosom, and every thing—at the time I ran against her I heard footsteps running from the immediate spot, going towards the end of the alley—this is the bonnet she had on—it was in this state. With blood on it, then—I took her into her own cottage, and on the door-post of the cottage I observed blood spirted, and also on the brick reveal, which was lime-whited and showed the blood—on going into the cottage, blood fell from her person—she was quite exhausted—her spirits kept her body up—in a few minutes she got round a bit—the prisoner was brought to the cottage by the police the same evening—I was down stairs, and Haines and his wife were up stairs—I heard a few words pass, such as "Why did you do it?"—the first words I heard the prisoner say were, "Well, I did it; you shall know what for"—I then heard him say, "I did it for revenge and satisfaction"—Mrs. Haines is a peaceable woman, and respectable in her station.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, and live at Holloway. I was called on the 14th of Nov. to see Mrs. Haines at the cottage at the back of Paradise-terrace—I found her very much exhausted, and several wounds on her head, which had bled considerably, but were not bleeding much then—there were five incised wounds, which were also bruised—one of an angular shape, which corresponded with the front hole through her bonnet—another angular one, about two inches more backwards; which corresponded with no hole in her bonnet—a third, about two inches and a half from the centre, and two on the right side—there were two contusions on the back of the head, one about the size of a walnut, the other not quit so large—they were serious injuries—I consider a chisel the most likely instruments to have done it—I attended her about weeks—the cuts appeared to have been inflicted with considerable violence, as although the bonnet was on, the scull was laid bare in three places—the hair was also cut through—I had reason to fear on the 16th that her life might be danger—there was a trifling wound on her ankle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>much at one end—on examining the bonnet I find both the holes are narrow, and the straw requires something cutting to divide it—I am satisfied it was a sharp instrument, and something narrow—it is a clean cut—the con<lb></lb>tusion might have been made at the time the wound was inflicted, or by subsequent blows—the candlestick might inflict the wounds without the bonnet, but not with the bonnet on—there was no blood on the candlestick.</p>

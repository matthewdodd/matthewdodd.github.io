                  </hi> I live in Wellington-street, St. Luke's. On 15th April, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I met the two prisoners at the end of Brick-lane, Old-street—they came up and spoke to me—I stopped talking a few minutes, and they began to pull me about—I found Brown's hand in my pocket, and saw her hand pass to Handley, who was close by—I heard three or four sovereigns drop—I stooped to pick them up—I</p>

               <p>had previously had some loose silver in my right-hand trowser's pocket, gold ring, and twelve sovereigns, and one half-sovereign, in a purse—I know that I had the money in my pocket at the time I saw them—I put my band into my pocket after I saw Brown take her hand out, and I found nothing but the loose silver—the purse had been put back into my pocket, but it had nothing in it; the twelve sovereigns and a half, and the ring, were gone—I never saw the purse out of my pocket—I accused the prisoners of robbing me—they said the money they dropped was money they had taken over night—I called two policeman to my asistance—some money was heard in Brown's mouth—it was not found; she swallowed it—I saw them stoop and pick up the remainder of the money, except one sovereign, which I picked up—Brown told Handley to pick up some money, and Handley picked up some; I cannot say much—when the officers came up, I said that Brown had some money in her mouth—I saw her pass something to her mouth, and heard it rattle against her teeth—I had hold of her hand at that time—the officers took charge of both the prisoners—Handley struggled very much, and when we came back from the station we found the gold ring in the kennel, on the spot—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can swear to it by its being scratched round the edge, and bent in two or three places—I have it in my possession since my wife died—it was her wedding-ring.</p>

About half-past one o'clock, in the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 15th April, I heard a scuffle up a court in Brick-lane—I and Reeves went up, and found the prisoners and the prosecutor, who was making a desperate effort to keep them in the curt—he said, "They have robbed me of twelve sovereigns and a half, and a ring"—he said Brown had put, her hand in his right-hand trowser's pocket and took it out from a purse, and she had just put some in her mouth; but previously, in passing some of the money to Handley, it had dropped, and that one said to the other, "Pick it up"—he said, "I have picked up a sovereign myself; they have picked up the rest"—the prisoners said they had not robbed him—I took Handley, and my brother officer took Brown—Handley made great resistance, and I saw her throw her hand on one side, and heard something fall, but I could not say what—I saw Brown with her hand towards her mouth, and I heard something rattle in her mouth; I could not distinctly say what it was, but I</p>

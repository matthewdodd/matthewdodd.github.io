                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-proprietor, living at 20, Great Blind-street, Dover-road. On 20th March, I was on the stand in Upper Thames-street—the prisoner came up to me, and asked whether I could speak French—I said I could not—I took him to a friend of mine, Mr. Unsworth, on Fish-street-hill—he there took a little pocket-book from hit side pocket, took from it two pieces of paper, and asked for pen and ink, having spoken some words previously—he laid the papers down on the counter, took the pen and wrote about eleven or twelve words (<hi rend="italic">looking at the bill</hi>)—It was something like this that he wrote—when he took his hand up I saw an "S"—I cannot say that I saw him make all the words—he was writing on the paper—he put his pen in the ink, and wrote some words, and when he lifted up his hand I saw the letter "S"—I should say that his pen made marks by the way he was writ<lb></lb>ing—I was standing close by him—I cannot swear that the "S" was not there before—I should say he was writing—he was moving his hand, and when he had done he took it up, and looked at it as if to see that it was done correctly, and he handed them to Mr. Unsworth—I did not notice whether the ink was wet or dry—after this was done I was told to fetch a cab, and the prisoner and Mr. Unsworth got in—I drove them to Messrs. Coutts' bank in the Strand—I there got off my box to let them out, and I saw the prisoner give Mr. Unsworth two pieces of paper which Mr. Unsworth took into Messrs. Coutts'—the prisoner remained in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—after Mr. Unsworth had been the bank a short time, somebody left the bank and came to me—in consequence of which I remained by my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—after about a quarter of an hour Mr. Unsworth came out—the prisoner came with him—he had gone into the bank to Mr. Unsworth—they got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> again, and I drove to Copthall-chambers.</p>

               <p>his pocket-book, took out two papers, and put them down on the counter—he then took the pen and ink, but what he wrote I could not tell—I could not swear that he even wrote upon it—I was some distance away—he then gave me the bills to look at—I do not remember anything that was written on them; I did not take any notice; I was looking to see where he wanted to go by the bills—I did not notice whether the ink was fresh or not—he told me one was for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he wished to go to Coutts' bank—he asked if I had got any money, as he had no money of his own, and I lent him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we then went in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—when we got about half or three<lb></lb>quarters of a mile from Coutts' bank he told me to stop the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> which I did, and he got out and went into a stationer's shop—he stopped there about two minutes—I was afraid he would be too late at the bank to get the notes changed, and went in to fetch him—he came out with me, and we then pro<lb></lb>ceeded to the bank—on the road he said I might take the change in what money I thought proper, either in gold or notes—on reaching the bank he gave me the two bills out of his pocket, and I took them into the bank and presented them both at the counter—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—on pre<lb></lb>senting them the clerks began to whisper one to the other, and refused payment—I asked them to have the kindness to go and not let the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> go away—in about a quarter of an hour the prisoner came into the bank and asked for Mr. Cahn's address—nothing occurred there to make him ask that—nothing was said about Mr. Cahn—the address was given, and I left the bank with the prisoner—I told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to drive to the address which the banker's clerk had given me, and the prisoner pressed me to go to Mr. Cahn's—we went and saw Mr. Cahn—I gave him the two bills which I had kept in my possession—the prisoner was by at the time—Mr. Cahn examined them, and said he should keep them, he should not deliver them back—the pri<lb></lb>soner immediately said if Mr. Cahn would pay him his passage there and back to Paris he would be satisfied.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, in partnership with my brother, at 3, Copthall Chambers. The endorsement, "Solomon Cahn," to this 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-bill, was not written by me, or with my authority—it was brought to me by Unsworth and the prisoner—I told them that the bills must either have been lost or stolen, and I should detain them—we expected such bills from Cahn Brothers, of Paris, relations of mine—I asked the prisoner particularly whether he had been to Messrs. Coutts' to get the money—he said, "No"—I looked at the back of the bills, and saw that our signature had been forged—I imme<lb></lb>diately suspected that he must have been to Messrs. Coutts' to get the money, because the bills are acquitted—that is the usual acquittance—it is in French, but that makes no difference, they would have paid it just the same—in order</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185004080085"></xptr>
               <p>to obtain the money from Coutts' when bills are so directed, it is necessary to write that—I asked the prisoner again to tell me whether he had been to Messrs. Coutts to get the money, and then he said he had been there to find out our address—that was not very likely—then Mr. Unsworth, who had not said anything all the while, said to me, "That is the biggest lie that was ever told, because we went up to Messrs. Coutts' in the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and he told me parti<lb></lb>cularly to get the money for him, either in notes or in gold"—the prisoner afterwards said, when I asked how he became possessed of the bills, that he was taking a walk in Paris, and met a young man who bad these bills in his hand, and he was going to tear them up; that he went up to him, and told him it was a great pity to tear those bills up, he would go over to London, I do not exactly recollect whether he said he would deliver them, or get the money for them, but he said something to that effect—I then gave him into custody.</p>

            . I am a headborough. On the 25th of February I took the prisoner up at the door of Worship-street Office, and asked what he had done with the things he had taken from the prosecutor? he said he had taken nothing. The magistrate sent me to No. 8, Whitecross-street, where the prisoner said he lived. I went there, but found no such person lived there. I found a hat at No. 8, Pope's Head-court, Whitecross-street. on the ground floor, also a shift, a handkerchief, and apron.</p>

            . I live next door to Hogg. About eleven o'clock I saw the prisoner go by and go to the bottom of the court - he then returned whistling. In about ten minutes he came back in a direction from the house, with a bundle under his arm - he walked exceedingly quick - I heard of the robbery about five minutes after. In about a quarter of an hour I saw him pass again, and asked him what he had done with the bundle that he had passed my house with? He said he had taken it to Worship-street Office - I said I would go with him to ascertain if it was so. I walked by his side, and when he got there he denied having told me any thing about it, and said he came there about a bad shilling. I gave him into custody.</p>

On the 8th of No<lb></lb>vember I left a portmanteau at the Angel Inn, in Farringdon-street—it was fetched away on the Saturday following—I observed that the catch of the lock had been affected, and I missed from the portmanteau a shirt, a pair of shoes, and the other articles stated in the indictment, which were worth at the lowest estimate 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to the Angel, and found my shirt on the prisoner's back—he was under-ostler there.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner at the Angel yard—he was acting there as a servant—he denied the robbery—the prosecutor then asked him to let him look at his shirt—I took him into the stable, and the prosecutor identified this shirt, which was on the prisoner's back—the prisoner said it was his own—the other things were mentioned, and he said he knew nothing about them—but on the Thursday following, as we were going to Guildhall, he said, if the prosecutor would not appear against him he would make the things all right.</p>

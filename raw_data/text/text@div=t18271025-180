Bank-notes, in my pocket - I had been paid off the day before - my money was in a purse in my breast-pocket - they were all safe in the afternoon; when I came out of a public-house, about nine o'clock at night, I met four women - my money was safe then - they said they would take me home - they were leading me home - the prisoners were walking after me - there were more men; the women and men appeared to know each other - the two prisoners laid hold of me; I am sure of that; they made a stop opposite Old Gravel-lane - the woman ran her hand into my bosom - I thought to catch hold of her, but one of the prisoner's laid hold of me across my breast, and the other took hold of my arm - they both held me, and asked me what was amiss - they then gave me a shove into the highway, and ran off the same way as the woman had. I felt her take the purse while they held me - it was on Saturday, the 24th or 25th of August - I went home, and gave information on the Monday or Tuesday - I have not found my money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHER. Q. How much had you been drinking? A. I had a share of four or five pots of beer - some people sat there - I treated them all as they came in - I was sober enough to walk straight, and know what I was doing - I had seven sovereigns and some silver besides - I know it was safe when I came out of the public-house - I had received it at Somerset-house - I know Catherine White - I had gone out with her between 5 and 6 o'clock - she drank nothing that I know of - I had some beer and a glass of gin or so - I recollect changing a sovereign to pay for liquor while she was with me - a quarrel arose in the house - I took off my jacket, and gave it to her to take care of - she returned it to me - the prisoners followed me all the way from the house - I looked over my shoulder and saw them - the purse was between my shirt and Guernsey frock - I called out that I had been robbed - the prisoners took hold of me the moment the girl took the money - she was convicted last Session.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you for one of your customers a gentleman of the name of Angelo - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of finding the bills not paid, did you question him about it - A. Yes, as for me he said I was rich enough, I did not want the money, he could not get it in, I was very much dissatisfied not getting my money in, I frequently spoke to him why he did not collect it in, he said he was pressed for time, I said I would give him four or five days, I charged him with Mr. Miles's fifteen pound. On Monday morning when I came to town he was not in the way, he was gone to Gloucester-place to wait upon a customer. I did not see him any more till Townshend the officer took him, then I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then - A. On the Friday or Saturday he sent me a list of the debts that he had collected in, this is the list, it is his own hand-writing, in this list there is no account of Mr. Angelo, it is a list of sixty-nine pound, I told him that could not go on with him any more. I was sure that he did not give me the money that he had collected in.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this you had occasion to look in your books - A. I had; on searching my books, I discovered that he must have received from a thousand to thirteen hundred pounds that he has not accompted for, he has taken money of the gentleman, I have got the receipts in my pocket, I know it by the ostler, he is here, he received the money, and gave it to him.</p>

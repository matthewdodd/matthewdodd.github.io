               <p>Q. What sort of goods?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Sugars and ginger. I saw the two constables, Emerson and Clark, each take hold of a man, and take ginger from each man's pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the prisoners the two men?</p>
               <p>Taylor. They were like them, but I will not swear that; I was subpoena'd here to prove the property. There are two sorts of ginger, black and white; it was black which I was landing, and was the property of

            . I am a constable. I was walking along the stations in the morning the first of October, about eight o'clock; I saw Evans standing pretty near the bags. I came, and the other prisoner came again between nine and ten; I gave my partner notice of them. Evans set himself down on a bag, and was a pilfering out of it. I saw him put some ginger into his pocket; then he got off the bag, and Potts came and did the same; then we took them directly. It is the common way of such, to take about a pound at a time, and go and unload, and come again may be 20 or 30 times in a day. We searched them, and took black ginger from each of them. This bag was whole before; we observed it was cut where the ginger was taken from, and we found a knife in Potts's pocket.</p>

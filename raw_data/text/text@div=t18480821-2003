On 29th July, about half-past four in the morning, I saw the prisoners coming along Marylebone-street towards Oxford-street—they each had a bundle—they looked at me—I went to the station, got assistance, and followed them into Woodstock-street—I asked Hall what he had got—he said "These," holding up a handkerchief, and that he had brought them from Notting-hill, that they belonged to him, and he was moving them himself to prevent their being scratched—we took them both to the station—I said to Hall, "You say these boxes belong to you?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Who is this?" pointing to Stewart—he said, "My brotber-in-law"—I said, "If these boxes belong to you, you have got the keys of them"—he said, "Yes, these two keys open three of the boxes," and gave them me from his pocket—I said, "Whose box is this?"—he said, "My sister's"—I said, "What is in it?"—he said, "Tapes, cottons, and other things"—the key opened it—it contained those sort of things—I said, "How is it you had it at your place if it belonged to your sister?"—he said, "She was in service at Porchester-terrace"—I found several letters in it addressed "Porchester-terrace"—I said. "Who does this box belong to?"—he said, "That is my wife's"—I said, "What is in it?—he said, "The same sort of things, I can't tell you exactly; I <hi rend="italic">don't bother</hi> myself about my wife's things"—I opened it, it contained similar things to the other, and a letter addressed "Miss Fletcher, Porchester-terrace"—I asked who Miss Fletcher was—he said a friend of his wife's—I found these purses in another box, one with money in it—I said, "Here is a purse, what money is in it?"—he said, "You will find three half-crowns and some silver"—I found three half-crowns and six shillings—another constable took two boxes out of Hall's pocket—I said, "Who does this one belong to?"—he said, "To <hi rend="italic">his</hi> sister"—I said to Stewart, "Does this belong to your sister?"—Stewart said, "Yes"—I opened it, it was quite full of tea—Hall said, he filed it full before he left—I said, "Who does this box belong to?"—Hall said, "That is my own, the key won't open that"—I said, "Where is the key?"—he said, "It is on my other keys, which I have left</p>

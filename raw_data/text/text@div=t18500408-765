                  </hi>. I am a widow. I keep the King's Head, in Church-street, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green—I know the prisoner as a customer—I saw him there on Saturday night, 9th March, about a quarter to ten o'clock—he left the house, and came back again about ten minutes to ten, and I saw him go up-stairs—there is a public room up-stairs, to which he had a right to go—there were other persons in that room—my servant-girl old me something, in consequence of which I went into my bedroom, which is on the same floor as the public-room—I found the bedroom-door shut but a closet-door inside the bedroom was open—that was always kept locked—I had last seen it about five in the afternoon—I then locked it, and had the key—on finding it open, I looked in, and missed a gold watch and guard, some spoons, trinkets, and other articles—an inner door of the closet was also opened, and from there I missed a box containing ear-rings, gold pins, a locket, a brooch, a guinea-piece and several silver coins, and a variety</p>

I was at Mrs. Tarr's house on the night of the 9th, in the public bagatelle-room—I heard a cry of "Thief!" ran to the bed-room, and saw the prisoner trying to escape out of the window—I laid hold of him—he said, "Pray let me go, and I will give all the property up," but I did not let him go—I took these spoons out of his pocket—the officer came, and I gave the things to him.</p>

               <p>I am the watchman. The prisoner past me on Friday night, or early on Saturday morning, between twelve and one, and she happened to have her apron full of bread; I asked her where she got it? She said over the way; I rather reflected on myself for letting her pass; so I followed her to the Queen's Head, the watering house, Bishopsgate-street, where she was talking to the waterman, and turning herself about I spies a pint pot stick out of her pocket; I said to the waterman, this woman is a pot stealer, for here is a pint pot sticking out of her pocket, and I took her to the watch-house strait, without ever letting her go away.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had the pint pot out of his house full of beer, and I met a poor woman that was ill and wanted a coach, and had this bread to carry; I went to the coachman to speak to him, and this man, the watchman, came up, and he spoke something that I did not like; I spoke rough to him, I had the pint-pot by my side, intending to return it as soon as I got the poor woman into the coach; then he took me back to this man's house and he said he would have me transported if it cost him the bed from under him; I had been but one month up from Cambridge. The gentleman said, at my first hearing, that the pint pot was worth half a crown.</p>
               <p>Court to Steward. Do you remember that woman being at your house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you let people carry away pots? - No, nobody but my constant customers.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. They were pots that I never send out to any body, they cost me three shillings a pint.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time the boy laid hold of your watch, did he pull hard at it, before it broke - A. It broke on my holding it; the prisoner was a stranger to me; when he laid hold of me he used dreadful oaths.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Which way were you going - A. Towards Little Britain. I saw no one till I felt the watch pulled - the chain was snatched at one snatch. I changed my umbrella from one hand to the other, then put my hand down, and it was snatched violently - I had not taken one step to run after the boy, when the prisoner laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not run against the prisoner, and he laid hold of you, and said,</p>
               <p>"Holloo, what are you at?" - No; he was behind me; I turned round to go up the court, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110021"></xptr>seized me; I collared him, and he caught hold of me - he did not ask why I ran against him; he did not give me his name or address.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Had you laid hold of the chain, to save it, before it was pulled from you - A. I laid hold of it, and it broke in the attempt to get it out of my hand.</p>

            . I am a watchman, and live in St. Swithin's-lane; I was going into Bridgwater-square, and close to Paul's-alley, I met a friend, with whom I was in conversation, when Perkins passed us with an umbrella - as soon as he passed I heard a scuffle, he was then about six yards off. I heard him call out for assistance - I went up, and heard the prisoner say,</p>
               <p>"Why did you hold me?" Perkins said,</p>
               <p>"Because my chain is taken" - and at that moment Herdsfield came up and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see any boy run - A. No; I did not hear the prisoner say, because you held me first - he gave his right name and address, when he was asked - he said he lived in the City-road, and was going to his aunt's.</p>

            . I am a constable; about seven o'clock on the 12th of March, I was at the corner of Paul's-alley. The prosecutor had hold of Lynch - he said he was robbed of his chain and seals - I took the prisoner to the Compter, where I searched him, and found no chain on him. The prosecutor said the prisoner was the person who prevented his taking the thief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner say, he ran against him, and so he laid hold of him - A. I did not hear it at all - I heard him say, what did you lay hold of me for?</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My mother sent me to my aunt's about seven o'clock - she lay dangerously ill, in Paul's-alley - on my arriving at the corner of the alley, the prosecutor was walking by me - he turned round, and accused me of running against him. He said, have you seen what has happened? I said No. He said, I beg your pardon for running against you. He stopped a few minutes, then said I am robbed of my chain by a boy, and I imagine you was in his company. I said no, there was no person in company with me - I gave him my address, he collared me, and I submitted, without the least resistance, knowing my innocence.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. About eight in the morning, the 28th of December, the prisoner came into our shop, and asked me the price of a book; I told him; he put it in its place again. He said it was for a gentleman, and not for himself, and he would inform him the price. He went and looked along the books in the shop, and then went to the door at the end of the passage, and I perceived him to open the door. He bid me good-by, and said he would tell the gentleman the price. I watched him, and saw him come back and go into the entry. I listened, and heard him drop a book in the entry. He could get at the books there, as he had opened a door that opens to the entry, without my seeing him; the door being on the inside. After that I saw him go off, with the books under his coat. I followed him about twenty yards, and locked under his coat, and there found five books. (Produced in court: Belles Lettres, in four volumes; A short View of the Families of the Irish Nobility; A short View of the Families of the present English Nobility; and Miscellanies, in Prose and Verse, in two volumes.) I knew him very well. I took these books from him, and let him go; and when my master came in, I told him of it. He got a warrant from Justice Girdler, and took the prisoner up; and before the Justice he confessed he had taken them; and I found Buchannan's history of Cambridge, which he had taken.</p>

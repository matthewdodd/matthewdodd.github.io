(The things deposed to.) I asked him who directed him to my house; he said he could not tell me; I found the pocket-book on Ford, I suppose he hove it away, for I never saw it afterwards; Ford desired the other prisoner to go and fetch the trunk, but he was not very willing to go, and Ford went himself and brought it; in the watch-house after they were committed, I found a pair of plated shoe-buckles.</p>

               <p>The first day of my coming on shore in the morning, my money was almost gone; we met a girl who took us into a house; I had no money, I asked the girl in the house to pledge my watch, she went with me and pledged it for 5 s.; I sent this young fellow for my trunk, lest the captain should stop it; we went to board and lodge with this gentleman, I went to the public-house to get my trunk, and whether she brought out my own or no, I do not know; if I had stole a trunk, it is not to be supposed I should lay it about.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a saw at any time, and a turkey stone - A. Yes, I lost them out of my shop, on the 3d of September. I left them on the 2d at night, and missed them the next morning, betwixt six and seven. I saw the turkey stone at the office the next day, and the prisoner in custody; I also missed an axe, it was never found.</p>

            . I am an office. I apprehended the prisoner in Red-lion-yard, Red-lion-street, Clerkenwell, about two o'clock in the middle of day; he was in bed with his clothes on; when I went into the room I saw a quantity of tools; knowing that Mr. Tanner had lost a turkey stone out of the frame I looked in the drawer, and found that turkey stone was afterwards claimed by Mr. Tanner. I asked the prisoner how he came by it; he said the whole of the tools was his own property. I told him to get up he was my prisoner, he did, I went to hand-cuff him, he made some resistance; I took a pistol out and said I would shoot him; he after that surrendered, I searched about the room and found some duplicates; one a saw, pawned for a shilling, in the name of

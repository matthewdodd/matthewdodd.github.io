I have a stereotype foundry—I missed some plates, and made inquiry of the prisoners and the other men, and the reply was, "Did I suppose they were thieves"—I said, "No," I have missed plates two or three years, but more particularly since January last—on the 1st of April I drove to town, and got out of ray chaise at the comer of the court—the police said they had found some metal, and asked if it was my property—I said yes, and sent for a proof of the plate, and we compared it word for word, to show that it was mine.</p>

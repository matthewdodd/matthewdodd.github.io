                  </hi>. I am a City-police constable. On Monday, 7th Feb., about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing with Scott, on London-bridge, in plain clothes—I saw the two prisoners and another lad, they were together and conversing, and walking towards the City—I followed them to King William-street first; and there I saw Smeade try to pick a lady's pocket—he was covered by Holloway, who was standing close to him to conceal him—I then lost sight of them, and about ten minutes afterwards I saw them again in Bishopsgate-street Within—I observed them notice two ladies—I could see they made the ladies a sort of mark—the ladies went along Bishopsgate-street Within, and went into a confectioner's shop—Smeade, and the one who is not in custody, went in the shop after them—Holloway remained outside, looking through the window into the shop—in about five</p>

               <p>minutes Smeade and the other lad came out of the shop, and they were each eating a pound cake—the ladies came out in two or three minutes afterwards and continued on their course; the prisoners and the other lad followed them, and Holloway got before them, and made a dead stand on the kerb at the corner of Camomile-street, so as to prevent one of the ladies passing off the kerb into the road, and Smeade drew by the side of the lady, put his left hand in her pocket and took out this purse, containing 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., an invoice, and a pill-box—I was in the road; I rushed to him and secured him—he threw the purse on the pavement; I picked it off the pavement—it contained a sovereign and a half in gold and silver, and this invoice, and pill-box—I took him to the station—I found 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

Between 3 and 4 o'clock, in the afternoon of 7th Feb., I went into Mr. Hill's, a confectioner's shop, with a friend—while I was there I think I saw a boy come in; he was about the height and size of Smeade—he bought come cake—he stood on my right hand—while he was there I pulled out my purse to pay for what I had purchased—I replaced my purse in my pocket—I do not think it fell through my dress on the ground—if it had I should have heard it—I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my purse—this is my purse to the best of my knowledge—I was not aware of my loss till the officer spoke to me—this is the paper that was in my purse, and this is the sum of money that I lost.</p>

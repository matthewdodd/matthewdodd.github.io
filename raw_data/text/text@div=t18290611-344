            . I am a pawnbroker; a woman came to my house, to pawn this saddle for 15s., on the 16th of April, about two o'clock - I stopped it; she said she would send her husband - the prisoner then came; I asked whose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110153"></xptr>it was - he said his master's, Mr. Arnold, of Torrington-square; I asked how he came to bring it here - he said he wanted a little money; I said, "You got it dishonestly"- he ran off; I pursued and took him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE KNAPP, JUN. I came in at the time the woman was offering the saddle - she said it was Mr. Arnold's, of Torrington-square; the prisoner then came, and said, it was his master's - that he was a confidential servant, and had taken it to make a little money of; he ran off - I pursued, and took him; he did not say John Edwards brought it.</p>
               <p>HENRY BIRGGS. I am an officer. I took the prisoner at the pawnbroker's - he said he got the saddle from some other man.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 16th of April, business called me out; I returned at three o'clock in the afternoon - my wife told me John Edwards had brought a saddle, and wanted her to pawn it for 15s., but she said she could not go out then; I knew no more of it till I came home, when she said it was detained at the pawnbrokers' - I went there, and told them the same story.</p>

The prisoner Foster was in my service; on the 28th of March two persons came from the watch-house, and asked if I had lost any flour - they had some in a bag; the bag was not mine, but the flour was; it had been in my flour-house which opens by a flap into the street; I missed 80lbs. of flour out of a sack which was full the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner FOSTER. My master told me to put some fresh and some old flour into the bin; I had not enough to make my dough, and I took that out of the sack. Witness. No, there was enough without opening that at all; he wanted about 80lbs. to make his dough - there was enough of the other flour which I saw in the trough; I can tell within a peck; I saw the flour at the watch-house, and it was precisely the same as that in the sack.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Clerkenwell. I was going to get a light of the next watchman, and met Cowley coming up Pear-tree-court, about three hundred yards from Mr. Aldridge's, with a bag on his shoulder - I called twice to know what he had got, but he gave no answer - I went up and said, "What have you got here?" he put it down, and said he found it; I said, "You must go to the watch-house, and take the flour;" he said he would not - I called another watchman - we secured him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner COWLEY. Q. Did I not say I had picked it up? A. No; you did not stop till I put my hand on it - you then pointed to a corner which I had passed two or three times just before, and said you had found it there.</p>

            . I am the watch-house keeper. Cowley was brought there about one o'clock on the 28th of March, with a bag of flour, and when I went out I knocked at Mr. Aldridge's cellar, and asked if he was there; I was told by Foster, (to the best of my belief,) that he was not - I left word that some flour was found, and was at the watch-house, and if he came there he might see it; I think the answer I received was, "Very well;" after Mr. Aldridge was up I went to his house again - he came and saw the flour, which he said he believed was his - he then searched over his flour and missed it; he inquired what house Cowley belonged to, and he said the Marquis of Gransby, which was the same house his man belonged to.</p>

               <p>FOSTER's Defence. This man is quite a stranger to me; he does not belong to the house of call to which I do; Mr. Aldridge is not the only gentleman who has the same sort of flour.</p>
               <p>COURT to WILLIAM ALDRIDGE. Q. Do you know any thing about Cowley? A. They both used one house, and I have heard that he and my man were about together; I do not think Foster would have wanted any flour to make up the dough, but if he did, it could not be near the quantity missing; I am certain there was nearly, if not quite, enough - I can tell within a peck.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are a waterman? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Alhallows stairs is what you call a free stairs? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. I am to understand you, that your own stairs are private stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Harriman. Did you give any orders to take any hoops to Lacorn? - I did not, we had not sold any to him.</p>
               <p>Court to Knight. You are clerk to Mr. Harriman, perhaps you may sometimes give orders? - I gave no such orders on the 7th of January.</p>
               <p>Have you any dealings with him? - He has bought a few bundles, two or three, but it is many months since; he had no account at the house, for two or three years; it might be three or four months ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is there no other person who receives orders? - Mr. Coulson, and Mr. Bates, neither of whom are here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit there is no ground to set the prisoner on his defence; for I take the liberty to say, that there is no charge against this man; the witness said, it was the account made out by the prisoner; and as against the prisoner, that is certainly very good evidence; but on the cross examination, that witness could not swear that account was made out by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. There is clearly ground enough to go to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I shall not trouble the Court with witnesses in such a case as this.</p>

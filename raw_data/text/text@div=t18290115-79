            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 20th of December I was in the Liverpool-road, about twenty minutes before five o'clock in the evening, and saw these two lads there; Taylor crossed from the road into the footpath - I turned, and said to him, "What have you got here?" he said, "Nothing but a breast of mutton, which I have brought from Kingsland, and am going to my father's in White Lion-street;" Thomas, who was with me, said to him, "What has the other boy got?" he said,"Tea and sugar;" we were going along with Taylor, and saw Tapps - I took them both into a baker's-shop: I found these razors on Taylor, this spike-nail, and this bunch of keys; I afterwards found Furr - he is a <rs id="t18290115-79-viclabel393" type="occupation">waggoner</rs>

            . I am the waggoner of the Peterborough waggon. I was in London on the 20th of December; this basket is mine - this tea and sugar, and these stockings are mine; there was also a piece of mutton: I had tied the basket at the hind-part of my waggon when I was coming up St. John-street, with a thick rope - when I got to Holloway toll-bar I missed it; the rope had been cut.</p>
               <p>TAYLOR'S Defence. I was coming from Crouch-end, and picked up the basket as I was passing the Adam and Eve public-house, about a quarter after two o'clock.</p>
               <p>TAPPS' Defence. I was with Taylor, and saw the basket lying in the road; we stood some time, but no one came - we asked two or three people if they knew any body who had lost any thing; they said No.</p>

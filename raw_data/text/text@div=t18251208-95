               <p>JOSEPH BALMAIN. I came to town on the 23d of November, from Maida-hill. I went to a house in <placeName id="t18251208-95-crimeloc477">Golden-lane</placeName>

I went out, and pursued the prisoner. I did not see him for some time, and when I stopped him, he was running as fast as he could, but he had thrown down the coat.</p>

            . I live in Golden-lane, and am a painter - the prosecutor was in my house. I went out with him, and pursued the prisoner. I saw the constable before us, who asked if we had lost any thing. I said, Yes. He said, "Come this way," and we saw the prisoner with the coat - when he saw me, he threw it down, the constable took it up. I pursued and took him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner and two boys come past my house with this coat. I watched which way they went, and then pursued them. Poulston came to me in Goswell-street, and said, "They had lost a coat." I followed the prisoner, and saw him drop it - I took it up.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Freeman's-court, Cornhill. I am clerk of the works, and superintendent of the Lunatic Asylum for the county of Surrey—there was some lead missing about the 21st or 22nd of September, 1839—it was a portion of the ridge lead, gone from a tool-house in the kitchen garden—it had been cut in length, and taken away—about half a cwt. was left—the policeman brought the lead, in a bag on the 23rd of September—I compared it—seven pieces had been cut, which were worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—five out of the seven were brought back—the prisoner had been employed as a labourer there, I believe during the month of September—the tool-house belongs to the Asylum—it was formerly the residence of Mr. Perkins, and the Magistrates of Surrey purchased the estate to build the Asylum.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable of Wandsworth.</hi>) I have known the prisoner twenty years—about eight o'clock on the 20th of September, 1839, I passed the prisoner in Garratt-lane, Wanda worth, about half a mile from where the lead was stolen—he had the bag produced with him—he turned up the lane to the Asylum—I did not speak to him—I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bailiff of Mr. Martin. I was so in 1839—Garratt-lane parts the Asylum from Mr. Martin's land—Mr. Perkins parted with the land in 1838—he had nothing to do with it after the Asylum had begun building—I had not seen him interfering—he used to do so before—in September, 1839, I was in one of our fields adjoining the lane with some men and women picking up potatoes—it was twenty minutes to nine o'clock, on the 20th of September—Mr. Heath's factory-bell had rung half-past eight—I saw the prisoner come over the stile into the lane into our pre<lb></lb>mises—he had a bag on his back—he ran into the first field, and threw the bag and its contents into a ditch, and covered it with some nettles—I was about thirty yards from him—I went towards him, and met him face to face—I said, "What have you been putting in the ditch?"—he said, "It don't belong to me"—I said, "I suppose it is something you have been stealing; I suppose you have robbed some poor man's house? let us go and see"—we were going to the ditch—I got a little before him—he slipped behind me, and ran away—I sent a boy after a policeman, who came before the boy got back—there was a bag under the nettles with something it it.</p>

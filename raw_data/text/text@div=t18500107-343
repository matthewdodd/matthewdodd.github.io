                  </hi>. I am the daughter of James Mettam, of the China Ship, Hermitage-street, in the parish of St. George-in-the-East. The prisoners had been several times to my father's house prior to 12th Dec.—On 12th Dec. they came accompanied by another person—Budd, and the other person who has escaped, came in first—it was about twelve o'clock in the day—I was in the bar—they said, "Good morning, Miss; how is your father?"—I said, "Not very well, he is not about"—they said it was very cold, and walked in, and stood at the entrance of the bar-parlour, which turns round to go up to the club-room, on the first floor—they went up, and I asked if they would like a fire—they said no, they were not going to stop; but they stopped, and I ordered the servant to light a fire—the bedroom is on the same floor, facing the club-room—the prisoners and the other man were all together when the conversation took place about lighting the fire—they went up-stairs together—my father was not about, he was in the bedroom—they came down about a quarter before three—my father was still up-stairs—they had several pints of ale, which I took up, as the servant was engaged—when they came down, they called for another pint of ale, and while they were standing at the bar it was proposed to meet there that day week—they left about three o'clock—after that, having answered the parlour-bell, I went in there, and saw Hughes sitting there, whom I had not seen come in; but there is a back-way to our house; the front-way is in one street, and the back-way in another, and going</p>

               <p>in once or twice, I also saw the man who has escaped, sitting opposite Hughes—Budd came in in about half an hour, the front-way—he walked quickly by the bar, and said, "Good afternoon, Miss"—he went into the parlour, and called for a pint of porter, which I supplied—as I had taken in the porter, and got the money, my father was coming down-stairs—the parlour-door was open—the persons in the parlour could see him come down—the parlour-door opens in the passage, opposite the bar—some time after, I went up-stairs to see whether the club-room fire was alight, and as I came down I saw Budd and the one who has escaped, walk up the passage as if they had come from the parlour-door—Hughes came out of the parlour, and they all three went up-stairs, saying, "We may as well go up, and have another game"—(they had been playing from twelve till three at the bagatelle-board)—immediately after they had gone up, Hughes came down, and asked for a glass of brandy-and-water—I said I would bring it up—he said, "Oh no, I will take it up"—I let him take it up—that was just before five o'clock—my father keeps a desk in his bedroom—I had been there that morning, about half-past eleven, for a check—the desk was locked; my father gave me the key to open it—I opened it, locked it again, and gave the key to my father—I did not take out any sovereigns—my attention was not called to the cash.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Mettam. On 12th Dec., about five o'clock, I heard a noise, which I thought was my master's bedroom-door opening or shutting—I went up, and saw Hughes standing at the club-room door with a glass in his hand, looking towards the bedroom-door—I came down, and told my mistress.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Mettam. On receiving a com<lb></lb>munication from Barber, I proceeded up-stairs, about five o'clock, and saw Hughes on the landing—he handed me a glass, and wished me to get it filled—I went down two or three steps out of sight, and, not hearing the footsteps of Hughes going into the club-room, I went back, and saw Budd in my bed<lb></lb>room, and Hughes in the act of going in—he was not where he was when I took the glass from him, he was nearer the bed-room door; his face was towards the bed-room; he was close to it, and the bed-room door was open—I was terrified, and went down-stairs—both the prisoners rushed after me down-stairs—there was another one, but I did not see him when I went up; he was in the bagatelle-room—he rushed down with the others, and escaped—when they rushed down, I seized Budd till assistance came—Hughes was standing very near Budd; they were both in the passage—Budd gave a snatch or two to get out of my grasp—I said, "This man has been in my bed-room"—Budd said, "Oh dear, Madam, you are mistaken!"—my husband then came up.</p>

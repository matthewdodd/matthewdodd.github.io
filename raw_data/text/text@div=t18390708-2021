                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Henry Floyd, a hosier, in Bishops gate-within. On Tuesday evening, the 2nd of July, the prisoner came to the shop, between eight and nine o'clock, and produced this note—I looked oat the goods, amounting to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he went off with them—shortly after I went to Dixat and Co., Bishopsgate-street, to inquire if it was all right—I afterwards overtook the prisoner in Houndsditch, with the goods in his hand, and the bill I gave him with them—I secured him—(<hi rend="italic">note read</hi>)—To Mr. Floyd. Mrs. Dixat will thank Mr. Floyd to send by bearer four pairs of black stockings, large size; two pairs of kid gloves, large size, ladies'; and a bill with them. Mrs. Dixat will send the amount by her servant. Bishopsgate-street."—I believed at the time he was a clerk in the house, and I said, "You have had a death in the family"—he said "Yes, Miss Watson, Mr. Dixat's cousin"—at the bottom of the note was a desire to send the price of white silk stockings, and that excited my suspicion, the family being in mourning.</p>

                  </hi>. I have a counting-house at No. 13, Bishopsgate-without—I live at Clapham-common. This note is not the hand-writing of Mrs. Dixat—I do not know the hand-writing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I submit that there is not sufficient proof that the document before the Court is not genuine—if Mrs. Dixat is in good health, or living, she ought to have been here to speak to the facts—having proved her connexion with my family, and having been in the habit of being at her house years ago, How can Mr. Dixat speak as to the hand-writing or wishes of any part of his family?—if it would hurt her feelings to come here she ought to consider a man's liberty.</p>

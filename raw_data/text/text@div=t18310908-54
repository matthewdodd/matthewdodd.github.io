The prisoner lived with me for three months, three months ago, then left, and came back again eight days before this happened; I missed some handkerchiefs the week before, and on the 26th of August, I found in the shop a paper, which I knew had contained stockings, laying down by the side of the counter - I referred to my book, and found no entry of their being sold; I desired to search the prisoner and the other shopman, to which they agreed - I found nothing on the other; I did not search the prisoner till the officer came, and on him we found one pair of stockings inside his boot, and another pair under his stockings, next his legs - he was not wearing either of them; they were as a bundle - I went to his lodgings with the officer, and found the other property stated in the indictment.</p>

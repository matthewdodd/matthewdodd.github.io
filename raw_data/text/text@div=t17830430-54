               <p>Court. What way of life have you been in? - I keep gentlemen and tradesmens books.</p>
               <p>What is your friend's name, that lent you this money? - Jackson, it was in Oxford-road, opposite to Rathbone-place.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - About dinner time, about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. You have described yourself as a book-keeper, you therefore must be a person of great trust and confidence, you will give the Jury a good account of yourself.</p>

               <p>Court. What are you? - By profession an apothecary.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - I am just out of my time, I served my time to Mr. Webb, in Halfmoon-street, I have been out of my time about ten days.</p>
               <p>Did you serve your time out? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Where do you live now? - I am with my father at present unengaged, in Fleet-market, he is clerke to Mr. Price upon Snow-hill, I have known the prisoner four or five years.</p>
               <p>You have heard the account he has given of himself? - Yes, about a fortnight ago coming up Oxford-road, I met the prisoner and another man, conversing about a pair of pistols, I knew the prisoner, and he knew me, he asked me how I did, and he asked me, to lend him half a guinea, I said, I had not a half a guinea, he said, it was to purchase a pair of pistols, I mentioned the impropriety of his buying pistols, and asked him what use he had for them, he said, to get something by them; I had not half a guinea, I let him have five shillings, and a guinea he had, he gave to the man; we went as far as Wardour-street, he apologized for the liberty of borrowing the money of me, and he said, I might want the money, and he would pledge the pistols for a guinea; he returned in about a minute, and gave me the five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300110"></xptr> shillings; I have not seen him from that time till yesterday.</p>
               <p>How happened you to see him then? - Passing by the Sessions-yard yesterday, I read in the bill of indictments his name, and enquired about him, and found he was in confinement, I directly enquired for him.</p>

             in the list? - I can swear to him.</p>
               <p>That I do not doubt, how came you to suspect that by the name, it was your friend? - I made bold to enquire, I did not five minutes before, know that he was in custody.</p>
               <p>It was a very lucky thing that you happened to enquire for him? - I knew his father and mother, and had been there several times.</p>
               <p>Where did they live? - They have lived in several places, they lived in St. James's place, then in Clarge's-street Piccadilly, and the last in Park-street.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - That was seven or eight months, they live now in Mount-street.</p>
               <p>You do seem to know them all very well, as you know them so well, of course they knew you very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They know that you are the son of this man, that lives here in Fleet-market, clerke to Mr. Price? - There was their daughter, was apprentice to a milliner that lodged in my master's second floor, through that, I became acquainted with their father and mother.</p>
               <p>You never heard any thing of the matter, till by accident you was going by last night? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was ashamed to trouble any of my friends about this affair.</p>
               <p>Court. It is the very thing in the world, to wipe off the stain of such a thing as this; is there any body here that knows you, any person of character here that happens to know you, because it would be very matrial for your character to be well established here? - No, Sir, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any body near? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court to Warre. Did you go before the Justice with the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What account did he give of the pistols there, did he mention his friends name? - Not a word of that, that this young man has mentioned, he said, he gave twenty-five shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Was he asked any questions, whether he had any body that could prove that? - I believe he was not, they know him pretty well there, and for that reason, did not say much to him.</p>
               <p>Court to Warre. What are those pistols worth? - I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>What have you sold them for? - Two guineas.</p>
               <p>Jury. They cost five guineas, they are worth four guineas now.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems very extraordinary that he was not called on, one would have thought the prisoner would have said, there is a young man of undoubted credit, that saw me buy them, and lent me part of the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The reason of my not knowing where he lived he was out of his time, nor did I know till I asked him.</p>

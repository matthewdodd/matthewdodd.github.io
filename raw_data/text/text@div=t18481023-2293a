                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter-carriers at the General Post-office. The prisoner was a letter-carrier, and has been so employed nearly seven years—his district was Long-lane, Berraondsey—at the latter end of Sept., from reasons that were considered sufficient by the authorities of the General Post-office, I prepared a letter for the purpose of testing the honesty of the deliverers of that district—I enclosed it in an envelope, and I saw Mr. Russell pat a sovereign into it—we both marked it—Mr. Russell sealed it, and it was addressed "Mr. Joseph Barr, Windsor Castle, 27, Long-acre, London"—the letter was written on the 28th, and the sovereign marked on the 29th Sept.—it was made up on the 29th, and I posted it in the hall of the General Post-office on the morning of the 30th, shortly after five o'clock—Mr. Gardner, the clerk, there received it of me—I saw the prisoner while on his duty that morning, between six and eight—the address on the letter was not an address within his delivery—supposing it was found among his letters, it would be called mis-sorted—it would then be his duty to take it to the blind-sorter, before he went out to deliver his letters—he went out that corning about eight—I was in Mr. Kelly's room when he was brought in by one of the inspectors at half-past eleven—Peak was present, and searched the prisoner—I saw Peak produce a sovereign, which I examined, and found it was the sovereign 1 had previously enclosed in the letter, and was part of the public money of the Post-office which I had had for the purpose (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I find both my own marks on it.</p>

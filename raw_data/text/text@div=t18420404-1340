                  </hi>. I am cook in the service of Mr. John Frederick Archbold, of No. 17, Park-street, in the parish of St. Margaret, Westmin<lb></lb>ster. On Thursday, the 3rd of March, he was on the Northern Circuit—he lives and sleeps in the house when in town, and his children were there then—I went to bed that night at half-past eleven o'clock—before I went to bed I barred the shutters of the kitchen windows—the shutters are in<lb></lb>side the windows, looking into an area, and there are rails—the catch of the window had not been fastened that night—there are two windows looking into the area—the street-door was chained, and had two bolts and a lock, fastened—the area-door was locked—the house was all fast except the hasp of the kitchen-window looking into the area, but the window was shutdown—the housekeeper went to bed before me, and the housemaid went up with me—there was nobody up in the house—I know the prisoner he is believed to be the house-maid's brother—on the following morning, fri<lb></lb>day, I came down about half-past seven o'clock, and found the dining-room</p>

               <p>door open, and two bottles on the table, three wine glasses, and wine in two of them; a cork-screw, a short tobacco-pipe, and a dish with a piece of plum pudding left in it—none of those things had been in the dining-room over-night—there was nearly the whole of a plum pudding left in the larder over-night—the piece left was about as big as my hand—the street-door was found open—it had been bolted, chained, and locked over-night—I went down and found the cellar-door open—I went into the kitchen, and found the dresser-drawers open, and the things turned out on the dresser—there was a candlestick on the scullery-table, which appeared to have been used, it was so very greasy, and a candle in it had burnt down to the socket—I missed a candle from the candle-box—I found the inner shut<lb></lb>ter of the area had a hole bored under the bar, which would enable a per<lb></lb>son with a gimbelt, or anything, to lift up the bar—I saw the policeman do it easily afterwards—a person could then enter the house and go out by the street-door—the house was examined—I missed a violin and bow, an accordion, a silver mug, and two opera-glasses, also a shilling and sixpence belonging to the house-maid, Priscilla Lawrence—it was taken out of her box—this is master's violin and bow, opera-glass, accordion, silver mug, and double opera-glass—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the articles.</hi>)</p>

On Friday, the 4th of March, I was asked to sleep in the house—I had a bed made up in the study—I have slept there until last Friday, when Mr. Archbold returned from the circuit—I was disturbed on the night of the 9th while sleeping there, and on Sunday, the 13th, about six o'clock in the morning, I was again disturbed—I heard the policeman come and look over the rails and go away—I then heard him in Queen-square—part of the house looks into Queen-square—he came and looked over the rails, and as soon as he was gone I heard a noise in the area opposite the window—I looked out and saw the prisoner there with his hand on a pane of glass—I got out of the study windows over the rails—I saw him get over the rails—I ran after him into Dartmouth-street—he was never out of my sight till he was secured.</p>

I fetch'd a Pint of Drink for her, but she had a Dram first. She promised what great Things she would do, as she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174602260015"></xptr> has to a great many besides me. She was to go to take her Quarter's Money, and that she had found Ten Queen Anne's Guineas, and promised to make me a Present of One when I had winded my Silk to carry it home. Now says she, I will go to George's Yard. They know her. Says she, do you carry your Work home, and I'll go there and order a Steake, something hot for the Mouth, against Twelve o'Clock: I must be at the Inn at One: So I went and told another Person of it, and she had decoy'd her with the same Story. I went to ask if such a one was there; she said, she was not, but she was here last Night. I said, she has robb'd me of a Pair of Stockings and a Spoon. This Gentlewoman, that I went to, was sitting in a Room with her Mother. Says this Gentlewoman, she (the Prisoner) is just gone by the Door; I went after her, and said to her very softly, Come, let us go back and see Mrs. Perguson. When we came into the House, I was in a Passion: I clapt my Hands on each Side of her, and found the Stockings on one Side in her Pocket; I threw them down at the Feet of the Table, and she said, they were not mine. I said, they were mine, for they had a Darn in such a Place. Now, I said, give me my Spoon: She said, she had it not, and made many Wishes. I said, let me feel in your Breast, and I found it there. If it is mine, it is mark'd with F. L. accordingly it was .</p>

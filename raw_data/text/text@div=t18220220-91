Five or six weeks before Thatcher was taken up, I suspected him, and told Britten my suspicions, as he had charge of the place, and in about five week I mentioned it to Mr. Nichols. The paper was kept in the back warehouse, in Cannon-row. A week or two before Thatcher was taken up, he told me he had taken paper from the warehouse in Cannon-row - I told Blanshard, and he was taken up. He said he had sold it, but did not say to whom.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Nichols's service About the 15th of January, Thatcher and Smith were quarrelling in the office, and Smith said he would tell something about Thatcher's conduct, that would bring him before a Justice; Thatcher said if any thing burnt in his heart to let it out; he was not in the employ then, he only came to see Smith. In consequence of what Smith told me I informed my employers. Part of the paper was found at Wright's, by the Coburg Theatre, some at Mahon's in Coburg-row, and more at Mahon's in Suffolk-street.</p>

            . I have been in Mr. Nicholls's service five years, last summer. I and Thatcher were employed to sell some imperfect books, for waste paper, they were sold, in the warehouse, to one Murphy, and one day, I said to Thatcher,</p>
               <p>"I should like to have the value of that pile of paper," pointing to it; he said,</p>
               <p>"I will tell you where you can sell it, without Mr. Nicholls knowing it." Two or three days after, he prevailed on me to take part of the money, which he said he had got for selling some - this was about October; I knew he had taken some away. My share was 18 s. On the Friday before the Saturday, on which we were taken into custody, Thatcher came running to the warehouse, in King-street, I beckoned to him to go out; he said</p>
               <p>"The old thief, (meaning Smith) has sold me, but I can bring up as much against him as he can against me pretty well;" I was once going out of this warehouse, with a bundle of paper; I met him, and he told me to go on, for it was all right, and at another time, I was in Cannon-row with him, and he asked me to take a bundle and to help him with his left hand. He then left, and was apprehended next day; he told me where he sold the paper - I do not know Eaton.</p>

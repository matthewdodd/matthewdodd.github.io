I saw this lady with her reticule - I saw the prisoner take the watch out of the reticule, and run off; he had not ran far before he made a plunge, and fell down - I was within a yard of him, and am certain he is the person who fell down; a friend of mine was waiting in the passage, and I came away immediately.</p>

I was standing at the entrance of the gardens, and heard Stop thief! called - I saw the prisoner run, and pursued him; he ran into a booth where there were two or three hundred people: I caught him round the neck - several persons told me to let him alone, as he was a publican's son; I took him back to the lady, and asked her which was the man - she said that was him; I took him into the parlour, and searched him - I found on him a ticket of admission to the dinner, 33s., and a handkerchief; he wished to see the lady, but I would not let him.</p>

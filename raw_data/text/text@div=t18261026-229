            . I know the prisoner; he came to work for me about six years ago - he came from Horncastle, in Lincolnshire; he sent for his wife, and she came up; I saw her, and have heard her say her maiden name was Rachael Pearce, many times, in his presence; they lodged in my house; she is now living in Clarendon-street, Somer's-town - she is the same person who lived with him, as his wife - they have a son about twenty-four years old, and a daughter older; they always treated them as their children; his wife is about sixty years old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know where she is now? A. Yes; I saw her six weeks ago - he called her Rachael, and also wife, and she called him husband. The children called them mother and father.</p>

            . I am niece to Mrs. Gray. I obtained an extract of the register which has been produced. I saw Rachael Jarvis at Clarendon-street - I afterwards saw the prisoner behind the counter of a shop in Windmill-street - I cannot say he was serving there; I told him of his marriage to Rachael Pearce, of Clarendon-street - he at first denied it, but afterwards said she was his wife; I said, "How could you think of marrying my aunt, when you knew you were married?" he said he knew he was a scoundrel or villain, and said, "I know I am married, and my wife is a good manager, a good liver, and a good provider, but our tempers did not agree;" I said, "You have taken my aunt's money?" he said, "Yes, I have;" I said, "Now, take my advice, young as I am - take 100l. and fly." but he would not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it by your advice your aunt prosecuted? A. Not exactly; I thought it my duty to interfere. I live with my mother. The prisoner and my aunt only lived together four or five days - she asked my advice about this; she is sixty-eight years old, and I am nineteen.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am compelled to state that Pearce never was my wife, nor was I in London till about five years ago; I never acknowledged to Finlayson that Pearce was my wife - all our conversation was about my running away. She was married to a man named Jarvis, but that was not me; I had a cousin named Jarvis - he came to town, and he was Pearce's husband; he went to America - she was visiting in Kent - we became acquainted, and we cohabited - I have a son and daughter, but I am not her husband. Whitehurst was my first wife, and I am proud to own it.</p>

               <p>Q. He said Ding it - what does Ding it mean - A. I suppose seeing of me it was to throw the property away; with the lights of the shop they all saw my face before I got to them; I had a perfect sight of the prisoner and the man before him, but not of the man that had the basket of raisins on his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is one of the men - A. I am certain it is; I knew the prisoner.</p>

            's, in Rood lane with a hogshead of sugar and five baskets of raisins; I walked most of the way behind the cart, till I came to the New London tavern; there was a good many coaches standing, I was obliged to go by the side of the horse; I had not been walking by the side of the horse above two minutes before I saw a man walk away from behind the cart with a basket of raisins; I thought it was mine, I directly went behind the cart and found I had lost a basket of raisins; I cried stop thief; Mr. Cartwright had got the man; it was very light; I saw three men in company; I believe one of them struck the officer; they made off towards Threadneedle street.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know whether he is one of them - A. I have not the least knowledge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. to West. Look at these raisins, are they yours - A. I really cannot say; the baskets are so much alike, though we have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. to Phillips. Can you say that basket, that Cartwright stopped, was taken out of your cart - A. I believe it was; the man went away from the cart with that basket, and the same basket Mr. Cartwright stopped the man with directly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you mean to swear that that is the basket you lost out of the cart - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am totally innocent of the charge; I never struck Cartwright in my life, nor gave him an angry word, nor never was in company with any body that did.</p>

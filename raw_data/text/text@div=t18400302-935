                  </hi>. I am a professor of music. On the 26th of Feb<lb></lb>ruary I was in the lobby of the pit of Drury-lane theatre—I had an opera-glass in ray left hand coat-pocket—I am quite sure it was there—there were a great many persons there, but I was very late, and was be<lb></lb>hind them—there were not many people where I was—I felt something go from the pocket in which this glass was—I turned immediately to my left, and the prisoner was standing close by me—I said to him, "What have you done?"—he said something, but I cannot remember what, and at that instant the glass fell—I cannot say from whom, but it certainly did not fall from my pocket—it fell before the prisoner—the officer took it up—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—when I spoke to the prisoner, I thought he was the person who took it.</p>

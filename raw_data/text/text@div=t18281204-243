               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you ask what I had in my hand, and I said it belonged to me; you made use of very bad language, and said what I had got you would have; and you thrust your hand into my bosom and under my clothes - I cried Murder! three or four times? A. Yes, she did cry Murder! - I heard a bad sixpence fall on the ground - I did not take her up there; I was standing to get something to drink - I was shut out of my lodging.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prisoner cried Murder! three times, and I came up - she said the man wanted to take liberties with her; he replied that she had robbed him, and he had got half a crown from her - he said she had got half a crown more, and a shilling; he picked up a sixpence from the ground - she said she had not got a halfpenny in the world.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was returning home, down Whitechapel, I met a person I had seen previously, who gave me sixpence to drink his health - it was so bad that no person could offer it - the prosecutor had treated me at a public-house before, and while I was waiting for the person who gave me the sixpence, he came up with two other persons, and said, "Old girl, can you tell me where I can get any thing to drink?" one of them said it was very cold - the prosecutor then said, "Come on, old girl, we are all on the look out;" we went to the side-door of a public-house - the prosecutor stood outside, and the other two called for half a pint of gin, or gin and peppermint; he then said to me, "I want to speak to you;" he went up a private place, and began to take very improper liberties with me - I said, "If you will go to a house I have no objection" - I never touched his pocket; he took nothing from me but the bad sixpence; if it had been a good one he would have sworn it was his - he thrust his hand into my bosom and under my clothes; I called out Murder! he said he would have every farthing of money I had,</p>
               <p>JOHN BLACKWELL re-examined. Q.Did you go to any public-house with her? A.There were two young men with her in a public-house: I went in and saw them, took a glass of peppermint, and then went out - I did not know them: we were not together.</p>

            , Q. Had the prisoner any pockets on? A. No, her pocket was in her stays; I found some duplicates there, but no money - the prosecutor was sober, and accused her of robbing him of 12s., but when they were both searched, the money found corresponded with what he stated.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Poplar. I was in the East India-road at a quarter-past nine, on 26th May—the prisoner had hold of a female's arm, and I heard her say, "Let go I—I knew her by her voice turned round, touched the prisoner on the shoulder, and asked him if he knew what he was going after—he said, "Yes"—I turned to the female and asked what he was doing—she said he wanted to take her to Abbot's fields—I turned from her, and lifted my hand up, and the prisoner ran away, and in four or five minutes he came and stabbed me in the bottom of my stomach I cannot tell what with—I was taken to the Hospital, and have been there ever since—I am sure he is the man.</p>

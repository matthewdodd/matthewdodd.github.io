               <p>I had been at Guildhall, and was coming home, I saw a great mob of people many of whom I knew, eight or nine in a gang; I stopped about four or five minutes; the prosecutor said to the prisoner, you have got my watch, accordingly I looked, and saw the watch in the prisoner's hand, I was going to lay hold of his hand; and I am lame, which stopped me a little; but I saw him drop the watch, he seemed to put it back for some of his comrades to lay hold of, but there were none; I delivered him up to the patrol.</p>

On the 9th of March I missed the property; the key of the room where the property was taken from, was taken out of the bar, and a strange key hung up in its place; about four o'clock in the afternoon the door was unlocked, the property was taken out, and the door was locked again; about eight o'clock in the evening she absconded; we did not suspect her to be the person that had taken it, till a person at whose house she was said she had robbed her of her things; my mistress went up stairs and missed the property.</p>
               <p>Q. That was on the 10th when Mrs. Gee missed the property. - A. Yes; I never saw any more of her till the 18th when I found her in a public house in Long Lane, with one of my wife's cloaks on; I left her in the custody of two men, while I went down to Hatton Garden office for an officer; when I came back again she had hid the cloak in the privy, then she was taken to our house, and from there she was taken to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. (to prosecutor) Mr. Gee, in the first place you recollect you gave me a guinea on Sunday morning in the cellar, and after that you gave me two pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did I give it you for. - A. That is best known to yourself; you asked me several Sundays if you should take an apartment for me and keep me, and that very Sunday morning you made a noise about the key, you broke open your room door, and you said to Mrs. Gee that Mr. Davis's boy had taken the key out of mistake; with that you says to me, will you have a great coat or a cloak, I told you I never wore a great coat in my life; you went up stairs and brought me down the cloak, you know very well you would never let me alone when I was down in the cellar, every one knows your character, your wife, and there she is, has told me that she suffered shipwreck by your goings on; if I had taken your advice you would not have done as you have.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never spoke a word to you about what you have been saying, I solemnly declare to God.</p>
               <p>Court. Now Mr. Gee, upon the oath that you have taken, did you ever give her the cloak. - A. Upon my oath I did not, if it was the last word that I breathed out of my body I never gave her a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back the cloak was hid in the necessary. - A. It was.</p>

I went back into the kitchen, and one of the men called out landlady, I went to see what they wanted, she asked to go to the privy, I went to the back door and shewed her where to go across the yard, and she went, she had the cloak on when she went to the privy, I did not see what she did there, she went by herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the cloak found afterwards. - A. Yes, it was found in a place that was broken in the ceiling of the privy, she must have stood upon the seat of the privy, and have put it into that hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that hole there before. - A. Yes.</p>

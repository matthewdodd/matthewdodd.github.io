On the 25th of October, I was in town, and met the prisoner in Wych-street, about three o'clock in the morning - we got into conversation, she said she would shew me where I could get something to drink; I gave her a bason of soup at a coffee-shop, we staid there half an hour. While she was drinking, I fell into a doze for a quarter of an hour, and when I awoke I missed my silk handkerchief from round my neck, and my tobacco-box and another handkerchief from my pocket - I saw her running out, ran after her about three hundred yards, took her, and gave her to the watchman - she ran out as soon as she saw me awake; she said she had none of my property; the watchman found the handkerchief and box - I had drank a little, but was more tired than drunk.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing on the 11th of December last. - A. Yes, all the articles in the indictment, my property and my lodger's; my lodger had left the property with me, I was answerable for them if any lost. I left my house on the 10th of last month; on the 11th it was broken open; I returned on the 17th and applied to the office; I went down with the lodger that part of the property belongs to to Gravesend on business, and was absent a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave in your house. - A. No person at all. I double locked my door, and fastened my windows with a pin and key. I found two trunks broken open; one contained my property and the others my lodger's; I had seen my things on the day I went away. On coming back on the 17th I found the door in the same situation as I left it; the front and back windows were both broken open; the window shutter was wrenched open, and part of the board was broke where the bolt is in; the front window pane of glass was taken out, apparently with a penknife; the point of the penknife was found in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your things again. - A. On the following day; they were produced by the pawnbrokers.</p>

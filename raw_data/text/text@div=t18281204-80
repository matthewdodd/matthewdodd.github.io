               <p>GEORGE SIMMONS. On the 8th of November, about nine or half-past nine o'clock, I was passing through <placeName id="t18281204-80-crimeloc415">Gordon-square, leading out of Tavistock-square</placeName>

            . I am a watchman. I took the prisoner, and as we were going along I heard a half-crown fall - I took it up; she said it was hers - she did not say who gave it to her; at the watch-house I asked what money she had got - she said very little; she gave me her pockets off, and there was one halfpenny in them - Tarry found the sovereign in her shoe.</p>

            . I am the watch-house-keeper. I took the sovereign from her left shoe - she said we could not blame her, she thought it was a shilling; she acknowledged afterwards that she had a sixpence in her mouth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was nearly one o'clock when he met me - he stopped half an hour with me; he put down his basket and said, "I have been waiting for you to give you a drop of gin" - I said a trifle of money would be more acceptable; he said, "Walk and talk, and I'll give you a little;" he gave me the sovereign for a shilling, and a sixpence - the half-crown I had from a gentleman in Tottenham-court-road; in about an hour he and the watchman met me - he said, "I have been waiting for you some time;" I said, "For what?" he said, "You have got a sovereign of mine" - I was then taken to the watch-house; in going along the half-crown fell - I said,"That's mine;" the prosecutor then said, "I think you have got more money" - he did not give it to me out of charity; he wanted * * * * - he is married, and has a family.</p>

            ? Q.Are you sure it was 1s. 6d. you gave her? A. Yes - I had received 30s. for my week's wages, and laid out 6s. for my children; I had then 1l. 4s. left, and gave her 1s. 6d. - I met no one else till I missed my money; I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the place dark? A. Not particularly dark - it was moonlight; I could easily discover a sovereign from a shilling at any time if I were blindfold.</p>

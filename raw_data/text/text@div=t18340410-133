               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Had you ever seen Ashman before? A. No; I did not see him for two minutes - I had travelled all night, and was fatigued - I am positive he is the man - this was as near eight o'clock as possible by my watch: it was not quite eight.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite positive Ashman is the man you saw the first time? A. Yes; he is the driver of the first cab that the coat was put into - I do not think I can be deceived - I swear he is the man.</p>

             (police-sergeant E 12). Yesterday morning, a waterman came and told me a cab-man was wanted, for stealing a coat and cap, and he would point him out to me - I waited till he came in, and he pointed out Bonnor - he said, there was a man in Newgate to be tried, who was innocent, and Bonnor was the man - I spoke to Bonnor about it - he said, "I have the coat and cap, which were thrown into my cab, they are at my lodging" - I went with him, and got them - these are them.</p>

               <p>Bonnor's Defence. I was the first cab on the rank, and the prosecutor called me, but we could not agree for price, and he called another cab and went off - I then got into my cab, and found the coat and cap in it - I took them home, and yesterday morning, when the policeman came, I gave them to him - there were plenty of people who knew I had them.</p>

            . I am waterman on the stand in Farringdon-street. I was there last Monday morning - I saw the prosecutor call a cab, which was driven by the prisoner Bonnor - it was not Ashman - he was not there for twenty minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time was this? A. About ten minutes before eight o'clock - the prosecutor called the cab that Bonnor drove first, and in two or three minutes he complained of losing his coat - I did not tell the gentleman that the driver was a red haired man - I said I knew the man very well, but I did not know his name or number - I know Ashman, by seeing him on the stand, but I will swear that Ashman was not on the stand that morning, till after Bonnor had gone off with the coat - Bonnor had a black horse - I never noticed the colour of Ashman's horse - they both had yellow cabs, but not from the same yard - one lives at Walworth, and the other in Theobald's Road - I have been two days and nights looking for Bonnor.</p>

On the evening of Christmas-day, at about half-past 6 o'clock, I saw Frazer in the New-road, Woolwich, with three large bundles, in two handkerchiefs and a bag—he went into a marine-store shop, and offered what he had for sale—I did not then know what it was—I went into the shop, found it was horse-hair, and asked him how he got it; he said it was his sea-bed, which he had ripped open to make money of the hair—I took him to the station, and while he was locked up he asked me how he should get on—I asked him how long he had the hair in his possession; he said either eight or nine months, and I believe he said he had it on board the <hi rend="italic">Fisgard</hi>—I said there was a large quantity, and he said it was a bed and a half—some time after that he said he had had it eighteen months—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

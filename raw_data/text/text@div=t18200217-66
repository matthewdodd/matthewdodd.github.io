            . On the 9th of February I met the prisoner in the Park, but said nothing to her then. I saw her again in about an hour on Constitution-hill, and asked her if she knew who wanted her? she said,</p>
               <p>"No, I don't know who wants me;" and I think she said,</p>
               <p>"I don't care." She had on a black silk gown, answering the description of one Mrs. Lee lost. I told her Mrs. Lee wanted her, and I wished somebody was near that I could give her in charge. I asked two soldiers to take her, they said they would have nothing to do with it. I followed her, and asked a gentleman where I could find a constable? he said at the Palace gate - one came immediately, but before he could get a sight of her she had escaped. She once lived in the family where I do, and I had heard of the robbery.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MONDAY. I am an officer. On the 14th of February a constable informed me that he had a prisoner at the watch-house - I went with him, and took the prisoner to a public-house opposite Queen-square office. I found a gown-body on her, which the prosecutrix claimed - she said she had pledged the pelisse, gown, and scarf at Kemble's, at Knightsbridge. I went, and found none had been sold or pledged there. She said she had sold the duplicate to a woman in Whitechapel, but she could not tell her name or residence.</p>

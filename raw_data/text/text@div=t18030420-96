Houlditch; the wheels were of a different colour from what they were in Mess. Houlditch's shop; I have known the wheels for two years; they are such wheels as are not used now; they had been newly painted.</p>

I could not miss knowing them, having had them in my hands twenty times; we went to Bow-street, and got two officers; the two officers, and the two Mr. Houlditchs' and myself, went up to the prisoner's lodgings; I knocked at the door, and got into the house, and the two officers went up stairs; I heard a little bit of a scuffle as I thought, so I followed up close to the landing-place; the prisoner was just come out of his room upon the landing-place, and the two officers with him; they brought him down stairs; they went into the yard, and found the wheels there; we brought him and the wheels to the Office in Bow-street.</p>

             sworn. - I am a butcher by trade; about the middle of February last, Cook and myself went into Mess. Houlditchs' premises, Long-acre, between the hours of six and eight at night, and took out a pair of wheels; Cook took one, and I took the other; we took them to my lodgings, No. 17, Brownlow-street; Cook took the wheels the same evening to his own lodgings, in George-street, Portland Chapel; the landlord's name is Smith; a morning or two afterwards the prisoner brought some paint down out of the painting-lost, which paint he desired me to take home to my lodgings; it was red paint; the wheels were a lead colour before; he told me he had coloured the wheels over twice with the said paint; I cannot swear to the wheels. That is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say you cannot swear to the wheels? - A. I cannot; I had been employed near two years by these gentlemen.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 6, in George-street, Portland Chapel; the prisoner, Cook, took my lodging, a two-pair-of-stars front room, about a year and a half ago, to the best of my recollection, and he has continued to lodge with me till he was taken up. I am a carman; he asked for liberty to box a wheel, or a pair of wheels, which he had done several times whilst he worked at Mr. Thompson's, in Mortimer-street, which he used to do in his dinner hours, and at night when he had done work; these were small wheels for trucks; I don't know who brought the wheels that were found in my yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. He used to do these odd jobs at dinner time? - A. Yes.(One of the wheels produced.)</p>
               <p>Jagues. This is one of the wheels we lost; you will find it a lead colour underneath, if you scrape a little of the paint off; I have had it in my hands a hundred times.</p>

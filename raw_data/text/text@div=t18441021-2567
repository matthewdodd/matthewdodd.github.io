                  </hi>. I am married. On Saturday night, the 14th of Sept., I saw Booth on the opposite side to where I live—I knew him—I saw him move in the gutter—I was on my street-door mat—I went out to him—I asked a person to bring me a light—a little boy brought me one—he was lying on the right side of his head, and I rolled him—his clothes were hanging about him in a very improper manner—his fob was torn off—he was all unbuttoned—he appeared to be quite in liquor—I have no doubt about that—he did not know me—I asked him, and he did not make me any reply—there was no violence on him—I washed his face, I thought he was another gentleman, who was subject to fits—there was gravel on his face—I saw his mouth, there was no blood on it—the witness Jackson is the boy who brought me the candle—I did not see Ledger—one of the neighbours gave me a quart of water to wash his face—a female brought it—a gentleman named Middle<lb></lb>ton, over my head, helped me up with him—he is not here—he then went away—I left him about twenty yards from where he was lying—he was very much in liquor—he went away staggering down New-street.</p>

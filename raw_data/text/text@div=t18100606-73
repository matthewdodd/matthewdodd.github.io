            . I was formerly a captain; I live upon my means, at 47, Upper Baker-street, Mary-le-bone. On the 6th of June I was in the crowd in <placeName id="t18100606-73-crimeloc401">St James's-street</placeName>

I owned the handkerchief immediately, I had it in my hand about a minute before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the worth of the handkerchief - A. Six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060039"></xptr>shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive the handkerchief go from you - A. I did not miss it at all. It was owing to the Lord Mayor's carriage coming, I was retiring precipitately previous to the carriage coming; I observed the prisoner, he was stuttering pretty much, talking in an audible voice to two or three men.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 4th of June, between three and four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner, he was in company with one more, he was standing behind captain Stopford; I suspected the prisoner, I had seen him in company before; I saw him put his hand into the pocket of Mr. Stopford, and take out this handkerchief; not three minutes before I had seen captain Stopford wipe his face with the handkerchief. Directly as I saw the prisoner make off through the crowd I went after him and brought him back immediately; he had not gone above five or six yards; when I laid hold of him he had the handkerchief in his hand; I took it out of his hand. His companion made off. I told Mr. Stopford he had been robbed, and I saw the man take the handkerchief out of his pocket. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse; he had got two other handkerchiefs, one in his hat and another in his pocket; he had got a wire, and an instrument that is used for star glazing, as they call it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was standing by the gentleman when he had his pocket picked; I did not do it; I picked up the handkerchief; and as for saying I had any other person with me, it is false.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger in the General Post-office. On 13th Nov. I was directed to watch the prisoner while he was sorting the letters of the Great Western division—I was in a small room near him—about twenty minutes past eight o'clock he proceeded to sort, and sorted all out of his hand, and rose up from the table with his left hand closed, and went over to a table a yard or two behind, and spoke to a clerk there—I went close by him, and saw him pressing heavily with his right hand upon his left, which was on the table—shortly after he went across the two offices, and went in a direction towards the water-closets, I noticed that his left-hand was closed—I went into the adjoining closet—I could see from one to the other very well—I saw him sit down, take a letter with a red seal from his left coat pocket, open it, take it out of the envelope, take some<lb></lb>thing out of the letter, I could not see what, and put it in his right hand—he then read the letter for a minute or so—I could distinctly see the letter, and I read the words, "Rochester, Nov. 12, My dear father,"—after he had looked at it, he tore it in four pieces, and put it down the pan behind him—it is an open seat; the pressure of the person on it causes the pump to act, and the letter would go down into the trap—a person named Russell was with me—on seeing this I made a communica<lb></lb>tion to him—I remained there till Blackburn the plumber came—no per<lb></lb>son had entered the water-closet before he came—he examined the closet on which the prisoner had sat, and I saw him take out these four pieces of paper, and the envelope which bears the postmark, "Rochester, Nov. 12."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the police-officers attached to the Post-office—I was with Forbes, and saw the prisoner in the water-closet—I looked through the grating, and saw him undo his breeches, sit down, and take from his left pocket a small letter with a red seal—I heard a rumpling of paper, and saw him reading a letter, and heard him put the paper behind him—he then got up—I remained till the plumber came,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber of the Post-office. I went to the water-closet on this morning, and found these papers in the trap—you can always find in the trap what the person who was there last has left—the papers do not always go away every time—there were several other pieces of paper there—each closet has a separate trap—the bottom of the grating is about one foot six inches above the seat, and the top two feet—it is six inches deep, and comes about the level of the shoulder.</p>

            , the man who was tried last Sessions, came in, and borrowed half a crown of Mrs. Hayes. for coach hire; she gave it him, and he went out, and came in again in about ten minutes with a box.</p>

            there were other letters, but I did not see what they were; then the soldier and Mrs. Hayes went up stairs, and stopped about ten minutes; then they came down into the bar, and I saw Mrs. Hayes with a diamond necklace, and a pearl necklace upon her lap. a pair of pearl ear rings, and large drops; I made an observation, and said, what a handsome necklace that was, and she told me to mind my own business, and go into the tap-room, and see if any thing was wanted; when I went back again, I saw several other articles; there was a comb for the hair, cut out in the shape of a star, set in diamonds; I believe in the shape of a star, or a half moon; and a gentleman's breast pin, that was not set in diamonds; I did not observe any thing more that night; there was a large supper that night; the next day, Mrs. Hayes sent the child down to a public-house, in Golden-lane, to Mrs. Hinton; she sent a pearl necklace, and likewise the pearl ear rings, to Mrs. Hinton, to ask if any of them would suit her; the child returned back again, and said none of them would suit her; and afterwards Mrs. Hinton came up, and examined the rest of the articles upon Mrs. Hayes's knees; but whether she took any thing away, I do not know; then between ten and eleven o'clock, on the Thursday, the soldier came; Mrs. Hayes said, come, Putty, take your money; they agreed that night for the things, and she gave him six guineas in gold, and one pound in half-pence; he had something to eat and drink, and I saw no more of him till eleven or twelve o'clock that day; then Mrs. Hayes called me to the bar, and told me to go to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between the soldier and her that night? - A. After he brought the box, he had something to eat and drink, and then joined the company that he used to be with; between eleven and twelve, my mistress desired me to go to the prisoner'house, and tell him he was wanted to go out with Mr. Hayes; I went, but he was not at home; I delivered the message to his wife; he came about one o'clock, but I saw nothing pass more than usual; he went into the parlour, and had a pint of beer, and then went away; but whether Hayes went with him or not, I cannot answer; I saw no more of Falkner till nine or ten o'clock in the evening; he came as usual to have his refreshment at night; that is all I know of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q.Hayes is a publican? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And as great a sinner as ever lived? - A. It may be so.</p>

             sworn. - I did live at the Bell, in Red-lion market, near Whitecross-street: On the 30th of April, or 1st of May, I am not certain which, Putty, or Collett, came to my house, about five o'clock in the afternoon, as near as I can guess; he asked me, where Mr. Falkner lived; I told him he lived in Whitecross-street, and in about half an hour, Falkner came to our house; he said, he could not stay now, he had got somewhere else to go, and he would call again; he called again in about three quarters of an hour, or an hour, he came in, and was speaking to Putty about some things that he had wrapped round him in an old coarse apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the things tied round him? - A. Putty; then they had a glass of gin a piece; I was at the door; and Putty said, will you go along with me down to Falkner's, and Falkner said, will you go with me and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010082"></xptr>Putty; I went with them to Mr. Falkner's house, in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Q.What is Falkner? - A.Something in the melting of gold and silver, melting gold and silver off buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. He keeps a melting pot? - A. Yes, that is his business, what they call a white-washer, and sweeper; I believe, when we got there, Putty untied his apron, and put all the things upon the counter, gold and silver, and what things there were.</p>
               <p>Q.Describe what things there were? - A. Mr. Falkner said, must I light a fire, a fire was lit in the furnace, and then he came in doors; the first thing that I saw, was a large gold snuff box, full of stones, set round in a row or two, they glistened very much; but I did not know they were diamonds, nor Putty neither; Putty asked for a hammer, but could not break it; there was a diamond necklace, with a pair of black strings at the end of it, two pair of silver buckles set with stones, one pair of women's buckles, and one pair of men's buckles; he hammered them a little, and got some of the stones out; one was an oval pair, I did not take much notice of the other; there was a pair of men's gold buckles, and a large gold fan; Putty gave Falkner two pearl pins for Mrs. Falkner, with a kind of a rose at the top; there were several other articles, that I did not take particular notice of; after that, all the silver things were put into the pot, stones and all, and I saw it all melted; and after it was all melted, he took a pair of tongs, and poured it all into a thing, just the same as they pour lead in, about two inches and a half wides and about ten inches long, as near as I can guess; after that, the gold was put in; the snuff box and stones, and altogether; Falkner took hold of the fan, her, says he, this will soon be disfigured; the fan was rather damaged on one side, rather cracked, it was set with gold, and pictures, that was all melted, and then poured out the same as the silver was; then they put it into water to cool it as quick as they could; after that, Putty and Falkner were dealing for the silver, and Falkner asked him if he could give him change for a 20l. note, Putty could not, and then we all three came up to our house; Mr. Falkner came into the bar, and asked my wife to give him change for a 20l. note, and she could not give him change; then he borrowed 2l. 16s. or 4l. I am not sure, of my wife; then he came into the parlour, and paid 4l. 10s. to Putty, for this silver; then they began dealing for the gold, Putty asked him 50s. an ounce, and Falkner would not give him but 2l. an ounce; then he said, he would not let him have it, and I do not think he bought the gold at all, for he did not deal for it in my presence; Putty told me, he had sold the gold for twenty-one guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you then, that you went with Falkner and Putty from your own house, to Falkner's house? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a carpenter, in Dickson's-court, Mary-le-bonne-street, Golden-square: On Friday, the 1st of May, about nine o'clock in the evening, I went to the house of Mr. Hayes, I had a pint of beer, and staid there about three quarters of an hour, when Hayes, Falkner, and Putty came in together; sat down in the bar; Putty sat down; he had the appearance of a glazier; he took from his apron two pieces of metal, gold and silver, about eight inches in length, as near as I can guess, about an inch and a quarter wide, and about the thickness of two-pennyworth of half-pence; the gold was of the same dimensions, except it run irregualar; one end was very thick, and the other end very thin indeed, it ran quite to a feather edge; Putty said to Falkner, you shall not have this under 50s. and he said he would not give it, but he would see whether it was worth it or not; he took the gold bar, and bit a piece off the end, and was going to bite another, but he said he had not enough; he returned the gold bar to Putty, and took the piece that he had bit, put it into a paper, and put it into his pocket; Falkner took the silver bar himself; he wanted change for a note, I cannot say how much; then he wanted to borrow some money to pay for the silver, but how much I cannot say; I heard something about four pounds; he said that was not enough, or something of that sort; Mrs. Hayes's back was towards me, and I could not see what money passed; then Falkner went into the parlour with the silver bar, and Putty with the gold one; I know no more of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This was bargained for in your presence? - A. I heard him ask 50s.</p>
               <p>Q. But the silver was bargained for in your presence? - A. No; I suppose they bargained coming along.</p>
               <p>Q.Hayes was by at the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And the money was paid on account of the silver, in Hayes's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you at Bow-street? - A. yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sworn at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the Magistrate at Bow-street what you have been telling the Jury to-day? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that? - A. I told them then I knew nothing but by hearsay.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did you say at Bow-street that you knew nothing about it? - A. I did not; I said I knew nothing but by hearsay.</p>
               <p>Q. What relation are you to Mr. Hayes? - A. I am brother to Mrs. Hayes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, Mr. Hayes has sworn very falsely againes me; I know nothing at all of the transaction; he, I understand, stood in the situation I now do last sessions; I know nothing at all of the business; he is now come forward under a promise of getting his wife's pardon if he will appear against me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called twelve witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010701-89-verdict485" type="verdictDescription">

             - it had been there I think three months; I missed it on Tuesday week - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>ANGELIUS BETRAUN. I am an officer. On the 21st of November, about half-past six o'clock, I was near the Seven-dials, and saw the prisoner with a bag upon his shoulder - he saw me, and hastened his pace; I followed him to Castle-street - I came up with him, and asked what he had got; he said he did not know - I said "I must know," and took it; he then said a gentleman gave it him to take to Bedford-street, Covent-garden, but he did not know him; I went with him, but there was no gentleman there - I then took him to the office; the prosecutor's shop is in Greek-street: this Bible was in the bag.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had it to carry, and was to have 1s. for it - I know nothing of the stealing it.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JONES. I have a copy of the prisoner's conviction - I saw him tried, and know he is the man; I apprehended him for stealing eight books from Mr. Doyle's, in Holborn; he was found guilty, and had three months' imprisonment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was here in my life - it is totally false.</p>
               <p>MR. WONTNER. We believe he has been here, and I charged him with it as soon as he came.</p>

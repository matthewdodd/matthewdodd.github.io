                  </hi>. I live at 1, Northampton-square, in the parish of St. James's, Clerkenwell. On Sunday morning, 19th Nov., about twenty nmiutes past twelve o'clock, I was called up by a police-officer, and found the front kitchen shutter broken open and the sash off, a pane of glass broken, the sash-fastening pulled back, and the sash thrown up—I had seen it fast at half-past eleven—I always go round the house and examine the doors and windows, having been robbed before.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Warwick—I was in the kitchen that night at eleven o'clock—I had previously put the shutters to at five o'clock, and put the bar up between six and seven—the window was then fastened—on Sunday morning the window was broken, and the bottom hinge off—I had slept through the disturbance—the window had not been opened during the day.</p>

On Sunday morning, 19th Nov., about ten minutes past twelve o'clock, I was on duty in Northampton-square, and saw the two prisoners come up Ashby-street, from St. John-street-road—they stayed a minute or two and then got over the prosecutor's railing, and went down the steps into the area—they did not see me—I was standing under a tree in the centre of the square, under the enclosure—I stood there about ten minutes—I heard a pane of glass break and the <hi rend="italic">scrooping</hi> of shutters, a curious noise as though any one was wrenching them open—I then went across the road, looked over the railing, and saw Cotterell go from the window into the coal-house under the pavement—I said, "Who is there?" three times, and got no answer—I then called another constable, went over the railing down the area, and saw both the prisoners standing in a corner of the coal-house—I asked Cotterell what he wanted there, and he said he had dropped his hat into the area—I asked Jones what he wanted there—he said he dropped his knife—they said they heard me coming, were frightened, and got into the coal-house out of the way—I examined the window and found it and the shutter broken.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS LLOYD. On the 11th of July I was at the Haymarket Theatre, with my wife - the prisoner, as I believe, came up and requested me to let him get a coach, as is was raining; I would not; he then followed me up the <placeName id="t18260914-331-crimeloc1866">Haymarket</placeName>

               <p>COURT. Q. Why did not you give charge of him at once? A. I did not know that I had lost any thing; when he was taken he was speaking some flash words to a woman, who was very angry with him for not taking both shoes - one expression which I remarked was,"What a d-d fumbler he was not to get the two - one was of no use."</p>

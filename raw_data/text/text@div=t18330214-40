On the morning of the 7th of January I was called out of bed, and told I had been robbed - I went down and found the Policeman, who had taken the woman into custody for going from my door with fourteen bottles of wine and two of brandy - I found my writing-desk had been opened, in which were the keys of my wine-cellar, and on going into the wine-cellar I found several dozens of wine had been stolen from it; I identify the wine found on the woman, and also more than seventy bottles, which were afterwards found at her lodging; the man now states her to be his wife, but when he came to me he stated he was single, and I believed him to be so.</p>

             (Police-constable E 157). On the morning in question, about twenty minutes after six o'clock, I saw the female prisoner coming down the steps of the prosecutor's door, rather heavily laden; she had a basket in one hand and a bag in the other - I asked the male prisoner, who was letting her out, whether all was right - he said Yes, all was right; we followed her about one hundred yards, and then stopped her; she said she had got some wearing-apparel belonging to a man who was going to leave the house we had seen her come from - we thought it was not all right, and asked her what it was; she said she did not know - we asked her if she knew the person who was going to leave; she said Yes, it was her husband - we took her to the station, and found on her fourteen bottles of wine and two of brandy; she told me where she lived - I went there, and found seventy-four more bottles, which I believe to be wine, and three small cloths and one large one; I then went back to the prosecutor's house, and rang the bell; the male prisoner answered it - I told him I wanted to speak to him; he said he would be out presently - he had the chain on the door; I said I wanted him immediately - he went down, as he said to get his coat and hat; still the chain was on the door - I rang the bell again; the cook came, she went and told him he was wanted - he made his escape from the house, and was not taken for three weeks.</p>

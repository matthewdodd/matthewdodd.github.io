               <p>Q. Was any body with you - A. No one. I saw the prisoner and another man; at first of their meeting me they asked me if I was homeward bound; I told them I was. They passed on before me, and took no further notice. They came to a small turning, I passed them there; they followed me back again. They went on my left, and crossed me on the right; they went before me again. I passed them the second time; the prisoner crossed and passed between me and the wall, and took my watch from me; they turned down a street, I saw them turn down, I cried out stop thief. Then in a short time the prisoner was brought forward; I knew him to be the person that took my watch; he was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch was not found upon him, was it - A. No. I value the watch at one-pound.</p>
               <p>MR. WHEATLEY. I am constable of St. George's in the East. The prosecutor came to me at the watchhouse, and desired me to take the prisoner. On the evening stated in the indictment, I heard the cry of stop thief; the prisoner was taken immediately. Upon the prosecutor seeing the prisoner, the prosecutor said the prisoner was the man that robbed him. The prosecutor was a little fresh; he seemed positive he was the man, and there is no doubt but he was the man; I had my doubt in consequence of the fog. I searched the prisoner; I did not find the watch. The watch was produced to me the next morning; I received the watch of Mrs. Jackson. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch.</p>

Then she returned again, and said the watch was detained for five shillings; he gave her some silver; she went out, and returned with the watch; she then delivered the watch to the prisoner. The prisoner delivered the watch to me; I kept the watch, sent for Mr. Wheatley; when Mr. Wheatley came I asked Mr. Spencer if that was his watch; he said yes. I delivered the watch to Mr. Wheatley.</p>

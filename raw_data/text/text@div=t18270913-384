            . There was nobody on board but I and the prisoner, when I saw him there; I had charge of the ship: he asked if we wanted a steward; I said No: he then went ashore, and I went down to feed my pig; when I came up he came on board again, and went aft; I heard him before I got quite up, and when I got up I could not see him; he then came up the companion ladder, and asked me to have a pot of beer - I said it was a wrong time, and he went away. I went down about six o'clock, to clean myself, and then missed my watch.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

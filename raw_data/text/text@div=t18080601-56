               <p>Q. When did you meet with this assault - A. On the morning of the first of May, between one and two o'clock, I met with Frances Spencer in Ratcliffe highway, I was in liquor, I could not find my way home; I I asked her to shew me the way home, instead of shewing me the way home she took me to her apartment in <placeName id="t18080601-56-crimeloc318">Seven Star alley, St. George's in the East</placeName>

               <p>Q. How much liquor did she bring - A. I cannot recollect whether it was a pint or half a pint; I was a little in liquor between ten and eleven o'clock; one began to beat me with the poker and the other with the fender.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you slept there I suppose - A. I was sitting on the foot of the bed, with half of my clothes on and half off.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you laid down and took a nap - A. I do not recollect at all; I was sitting on the foot of the bed all the time to the best of my knowledge. I could not lay down nor could I walk.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to stay there from between ten and eleven o'clock, till one in the morning - . I was not able to stand on my legs or else I would not have staid there so long; they beat me so I was hardly able to walk, they would have murdered me if I had not got assistance; the constable came up; when she saw the constable come she said she was sorry she had not murdered me at first. They took all the money I had from me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they take the money from you - A. Before they began to beat me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them took the money from you - A. I do not know; the constable found the money, they took two guineas, half a guinea, and three seven shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the constable come - A. I cried out for assistance; some of the people in the street went for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. When you come there did you find the prisoner Smith - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to bed with the prisoner Smith - A. No, not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. On your examination you said I met the prisoner Smith in the street, I went with her to her room, I remained there till about five o'clock in the morning. I went to bed with Spencer, when I awoke I discovered the prisoner Smith. I found I had lost four one pound notes; I then challenged the prisoner with the robbery; which is the truth what you then said or now - A. I speak the truth; I told the justice the same.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Smith come into the room - A.Ann Smith was in the room when I came home.</p>

            . I am a constable belonging to the public office, Shadwell. On the first of May a young man came to me, he said there would be murder done in Seven Star alley, at the lower house on the left hand side; he shewed me the room. I found Spencer's arms bloody from her finger up to her elbow; I found the man in the room bleeding at different parts of his head; he said he was struck with a fender by Spencer, and a little woman had struck him with a poker; Smith was not there, she came in a few minutes; I said to Spencer why did you rob this man and want to murder him; she said I am very sorry and made use of very bad expressions that I had not murdered him; she said she would not be searched there but she would in the other room; the rooms were all over blood; I found this protection box.

             had the protection box; in the protection box was two one pound notes, a half guinea, three seven shilling pieces, and a red pocket handkerchief that the man, had; I found the certificate of the discharge of the man it laid on the floor, and likewise some gentleman's address where he took some prize money. I found on Spencer a few halfpence which the magistrate ordered me to give her; she said it was his money, but he gave it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the other two one pound notes - A. I did not; Smith had been to a Jew's in the alley there; he keeps a bad house.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Spencer's Defence. I met the man between eleven and twelve o'clock on Saturday night, he had another young lass with him; he asked me to have something to drink, I said no, let him go with his own woman; he said he would not go with her; he gave me a seven shilling piece to get something to drink, he had only seven shillings in silver in the morning, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010045"></xptr>asked me to give him something to drink; I said no I would not; he said I should get up; he struck me with the fire shovel. I too up the fender to bar the blow off; the other young woman was not in the room at all; when she saw him beating me she came and wiped my hands with her apron; the tin-box is not his; I have had it ever since the beginning of last summer.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I know nothing of the affair, nor about the money; there was a terrible piece of work, I ran up stairs and wiped her nose. Mr. Brown took me. I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Brown.) Was Smith's hands bloody - A. Yes, they were both obliged to wash themselves before I took them out of the house; the water was as bloody as though it came from a beast.</p>

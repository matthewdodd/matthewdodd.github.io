                  </hi>. I live at Torquay, in Devonshire, and in London at Maze Pond. On Wednesday evening, the 28th of August, I was in Skinner-street, Snow-hill—my attention was called to my pocket—I found my handkerchief was gone, and I found it under the officer's feet—this is it—I was not conscious of its being taken—it had been in my pocket just before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I was in Skinner-street on the 28th of August, about twenty minutes past six o'clock—I saw the prisoner following the prosecutor, lift up his coat pocket, take his hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and put it into his left hand trowsers pocket—I collared him—he dropped it—I never lost sight of it till I set my foot on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He said he saw me take it out, and put it into my pocket—there were two young men before me, I looked down, and there was the handkerchief at my feet. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I never said so.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, agreed with his evidence.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It was not me that stole it—he said, "I have been looking after you all day"—he and another man were quarrelling who should take me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not—I had no quarrel about who should take him—there was another constable with me—there were five more in company with the prisoner, but they all got away in consequence of a wagon passing—I am positive the prisoner is the man who took the handkerchief,</p>

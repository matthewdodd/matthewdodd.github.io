I have not been concerned with him above four months; I cannot recollect the particular day. Steed and I went into Ironmonger-row, and seeing no light in the room in the prosecutor's house, I opened a little gate which went to the house, and shoved up the sash and went in; I do not know whether it was a parlour or not; I took out these things and gave them to Stead, and he put them into a bag, and we went away with them. I was taken up in a public house by Mr. Wood, who told me he had had a great deal of trouble after me. When I was before the alderman, I was asked about a robbery: I said I knew nothing of that; but I made information of several robberies that I had been engaged in, and particularly this.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was this bag?</p>
               <p>Biggs. I bought three yards of black cloth; two of them went to the making the bag; it was yard wide.</p>
               <p>Wood. I took this bag out of Stead's pocket. (Producing a black bag.)</p>
               <p>Biggs. This is the same bag. I took a watch-stand out of the room, but, it being of no use, I threw that away, about an hundred yards from the prosecutor's house; and we carried the rest of the things to Smithson's house, who was at home when we came there. I turned them out of the bag in order to see what we had got. I asked Smithson to go and pawn the silk gown; he went; and came and told me he had pawned it for 14 s. which he gave in; but since I find he pawned it for 16 s.</p>
               <p>Stead's Defence.</p>
               <p>When I heard Biggs was taken up (he and I had laid together two nights ) I sent a young woman, who was daughter to the woman where I lodged, to him; he desired every thing that belonged to him might be carried to Mr. Smithson's, in Shoe-lane: I put the bag in my pocket to carry to Mr. Smithson's, and unfortunately I met with the constable, who took the bag out of my pocket. I live in Golden-lane, and was going up Barbican when he stopped me.</p>
               <p>Biggs. The last night Stead and I were out together, he took the bag, and a tool we had made on purpose to break houses, home to his house.</p>
               <p>Smithson's Defence.</p>
               <p>The evidence broke my door open, and carried the things in; I was out at the time: he lodged in the house, and used to trade with people: he has sold pounds worth of things in the house; and has desired me to pawn things, which I have, and brought him the money.</p>

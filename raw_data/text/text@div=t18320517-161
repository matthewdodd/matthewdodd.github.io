               <p>THOMAS MADDEN. I am a constable of Kensington. On the 15th of May I was in the garden belonging to the <placeName id="t18320517-161-crimeloc941">King's Head, Kensington</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18320517-161-crimeloc941" type="placeName" value="King's Head, Kensington"></interp>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18320517-161-victim1334 t18320517-161-viclabel942"></join> Parbly - Gascoyne, the prisoner, extended his right hand to the prosecutor's right-hand trousers pocket; I did not observe where the prosecutor's hand was at the time, but I heard Jones make some remark to Gascoyne, who replied,"I can't get his manler off," which means a hand; Jones then attempted his pocket in the same way - some more words passed between them, and Gascoyne said, "Why don't you get his d-d mauler off?" I then saw Hutchins come from the rear in front of the colonel; he looked up in his face, and said Mr. Hume (who had just spoken) was a very clever fellow, and he added, "Before Mr. Hume leaves the hustings, let us give him three cheers"- when they were given Hutchins said, "Let us give him one cheer more;" when the fourth cheer was given the colouel took his hat off, and waved it as well as he could in the crowd, raising his right arm; and either Gascoyne or Jones was supporting his arm up; the three prisoners left the crowd immediately the fourth cheer was given - I asked the colonel if he had lost any thing; he felt in his pocket, and said, "I have lost my purse" - I ran through the crowd, and succeeded in stopping the three prisoners, with the assistance of some other persons, just as they were going out of the door - Hutchins had his right hand in his pocket; I examined his pocket, and found in it this purse, with two sovereigns and 13s. 6d. in it - he claimed it; I took them to the station, and asked the colonel to describe his purse - he claimed it, and said there were two sovereigns in it, and some silver, but he could not exactly say what - I found some money on Jones, and on Gascoyne - I found on Hutchins, besides the purse, a half-sovereign, 9s. 6d. in silver, and I think 2d. in copper, and a pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.What did you find on Gascoyne? A.2s. 6d. in silver, and 1 1/2d. - there was a great crowd, and the colonel was in the midst of it; there was no difficulty in distinguishing the prisoners - I did not go to the Reform Meeting as an officer, but if I had seen a breach of the peace I should have interfered; I was not quite certain when the attempt was made, and if I had attempted to take them then I should have had very little chance in the crowd - I was not certain that the colonel was robbed till I saw them leaving the crowd - I did not see Jones or Gascoyne speak to Hutchins; there might be one or two persons between him and the colonel when these attempts were made.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went partly as a reformer yourself? A. You may take it so if you please, but of course I was an officer - I applauded the speeches, but I never lifted my hand; I think the prisoners were more anxious to see others cheer than to cheer themselves - Hutchins claimed the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170090"></xptr>purse to the last; I do not know whether it is a common purse, I have seen many like it.</p>

I was at the King's Arms garden, attending the meeting, as I live in the parish, in Brompton-square; Lord Teynham was in the chair - I had a purse of this sort and colour, with two sovereigns and some loose silver in it - I missed it when the officer spoke to me; I believe this is my purse - I recollect the cheers being proposed; I had before that had my hand on my side, but when Mr. Hume was leaving the meeting, I lifted my hand, and took off my hat - by that means my pocket was exposed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was your coat buttoned? A. Yes; I cannot swear to the purse - Hutchins insisted that it was his from the first; there was a great crowd.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you observe any communication between the prisoners? A. No- I could not swear to any of them.</p>

            . Q. Did the prisoners go away together? A. They were close together when they quitted, and went at the same time.</p>
               <p>Gascoyne. I was not near the door; I was in the crowd - another person took me. Witness. I took him and Hutchins near the door; there was some crowd there - I called a person to assist me; I called to a special-constable to take Jones - they were all going away together: there were several speeches after Mr. Hume left.</p>
               <p>Hutchins. The purse is mine - I have had it three or four months; I bought in the Strand, where you can buy fifty every day - this officer did not take it from me; another person took it out of my pocket, and gave it to him- I said it was mine, and that it had 2l. 13s. 6d. in it. -Witness. He had his hand in his pocket, grasping the purse, and I took it; I said, "If it is yours, you can tell what is in it - how many sovereigns are there?" he said three; I said, "How much silver?" he said about 14s. - he guessed the silver right within 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure he did not say two sovereigns? A. He said two, after he saw the money counted, but at first he said three.</p>
               <p>COLONEL PARBLY. The gold was at one end, and the silver at the other.</p>

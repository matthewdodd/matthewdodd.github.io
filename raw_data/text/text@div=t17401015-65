               <p>Prisoner. How is he sure that I took them?</p>
               <p>Le Cour. I felt her, and took her Hand in my Pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How came he not to prevent me, if he felt my Hand in his Pocket?</p>
               <p>Le Cour. She was too quick for me. When I found that my Money was gone, I held her fast against the Wall, and a Fellow she call'd Husband, came up and insulted me. The Watch was called, and we went to the Watch-house; when we were there, she said she never saw me; but I am sure she is the very Woman. She was not searched, and I have not had my Money again. I am a Snuff-Box Maker, and live on Clerkenwell-Green.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was it in the Street, or whereabout was it?</p>

               <p>Le Cour. No one else that I know: None robbed me but the Prisoner. The Salop Man was at the Corner when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How far from the Watch was it?</p>
               <p>Le Cour. About a Yard an half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did he not secure me when he felt my Hand?</p>
               <p>Le Cour. A Man insulted me, and said she was his Wife; but I did call the Watch, and held her fast against the Wall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you charge no other Woman with taking your Money?</p>
               <p>Le Cour. No, none else; the Constable was present, and knows that I charged no body but the Prisoner.</p>

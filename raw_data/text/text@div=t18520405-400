On Saturday night, 28th Feb., I went to bed about half-past 12 o'clock—I fastened my bar, and locked it up—I was the last person up—I came down in the morning about 9—I found the bar window was up, and the fastening was taken away—it had been fastened by a screw—one of the panes had been broken, and a small hand could go in and take the screw out—I had some coppers in the till, I suppose 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth, in pence, halfpence, and farthings—they were all gone in the morning—this watch was on the mantelpiece, in a marble stand—I have had it twenty-four or twenty-five years—I cannot identify this stone bottle—this silk handkerchief, to the best of my belief, is mine—this hat, that fell from Williams, I have worn for two years—I am sure it is mine.</p>

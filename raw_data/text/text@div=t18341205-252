                  </hi>. I am a clerk. On the 3rd of December, a little before eleven o'clock at night, I was in the East India-road—the pri<lb></lb>soner came up under the pretence of begging for a few halfpence—I stood and felt my pocket—I said, "I do not think I have any halfpence"—we stood one or two minutes—she kept on talking—I then went away—she followed me a little distance—I then went on my road home, and when I came to the first lamp, I went to look at my watch, and missed it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were you talking about? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She wanted me to go home with her—I said I should do nothing of the kind—I then walked on, and she walked a little distance close to my arm, and when we got to the first</p>

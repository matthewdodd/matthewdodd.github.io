               <p>BENJAMIN BRIGSWORTH. I keep a coal-shed, and have a horse and cart. I know the prisoner, Bartlett, he sells fire-wood. On the 27th of November he came to my house to bespeak my horse and cart; I was to meet him at the Brill, which I did, and agreed to go; next morning he called me up at half-past four o'clock - I got my horse and cart, and followed him to Leadenhall-market. We got there a little before six; he told me to back the cart against the gates, which lead into a yard out of the market. I saw the prisoner, Cane, there giving wood into Bartlett's hand, who put it into my cart-it appeared to be old joists; the yard gates were open. When my cart was loaded, Bartlett told me to drive to Cow-cross; there were two carts, the other was loaded-Wilding had the other cart. Bartlett went on with Wilding, and Cane with me to Cow-cross; I unloaded, and Cane carried it into Chipperfield's yard, in Benjamin-street; we got there about half-past nine. I then drove home. Next day I saw Rice, and told him of it - I took him to Chipperfield's, and shewed him the stuff; we were going along Battle Bridge, and saw Bartlett at a public-house; he saw me, I went in, and found Cane there, Rice secured him, and put him into my cart - He resisted very much - We took him to Somers'-town, where he said he lived; we found it was false; as we were taking him back he jumped out of the cart - We secured him again.</p>

            . I live in Somers'-town; I keep a horse and cart. On the 27th of November, Bartlett applied to me, about eight o'clock, for it, to go with him next morning; he called me at four o'clock, and said he would meet me in the New Road; I met him there about five o'clock, with my cart; he was in Brigsworth's cart: he took us to Leadenhall-market - We got there about six o'clock; he went into the market, and returned and told me to back my cart towards some buildings, which was next to a yard with a pair of gates, which stood half open. Cane brought out some wood, and gave it to Bartlett; I put it into my cart, it was old beams-both the prisoners assisted in loading it; I drew up on one side the market, while the other cart was loaded; Cane then told me to stay, for it was rather early, and the men had not got to work. We left the market about half-past six. Bartlett told me to go on towards the Bank, he went with me; we went to Cowcross, and had some drink there; Cane said something to Brigsworth; Bartlett told me to go to his house with my load, which I did; he lives ten doors from me; I put the wood in his yard, next day I showed it to Mr. Cogdon.</p>

I was going round Leadenball-market the day after the robbery, about six o'clock in the morning, and saw Brigsworth's cart backed to the East India House gates-the prisoner Cane was in it; I saw the gates off the hinges, and went to call a watchman; when I returned Cane was gone; I overtook Brigsworth's cart; in consequence of what he said, we went in search of the prisoners, and apprehended Cane at the Maidenhead, in Battle-bridge; Brigsworth said he was the man that was with him; he made a great resistance; somebody stood against the tap-room door to prevent my going in. I tied his hands, and put him into the cart, and took him to Chipperfield's; I then went to Bartlett's yard; I took Cane to Giltspur-street Compter, and in going there I found he had got his hands loose - He immediately jumped out of the cart, and ran away; I caught him.</p>

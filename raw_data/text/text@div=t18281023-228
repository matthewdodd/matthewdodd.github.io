On the 13th of October, I was tipsy - I had been to see my sister in Laystall-street, and left there about five o'clock; I saw my watch safe in my watch-pocket when I came from the house: I think it was about five o'clock, as near as I can guess - I cannot rightly tell; there was a boy to take me home: I got into St. Martin's watch-house that night - while there I missed half a crown, and a sixpence or shilling: I do not rightly know which - I have never seen my watch since; I mentioned to the watch-housekeeper that I had lost it, and he said I blamed him for it - it was a hunting-watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. About what time was it you began to miss your watch? A. After I was in the watch-house, about ten o'clock, I believe; I do not know rightly.</p>

            . I was going home with the prosecutor, and in Broad-court the two prisoners came and asked where he was going; I said he was a Chelsea pensioner - Cooper said, "We are going to Pimlico - we will put him into the coach:" they went up Bow-street, and to Hemmings-row, and then another man took hold of him; I followed them all: they went on to the waste ground, and soon afterwards I saw the prosecutor on the ground, and the third man was with him - I went up to him, and saw his watch was gone; I said if I knew where there was an officer I would have the man taken up - I called out Stop thief! and the third man, said,"There go the two men who have robbed him," and he took to his heels and ran away; King came up - I said, "This man has been robbed of his watch;" I know it was safe before, for I felt it - King and I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did the third man come up? A. Just before they got to Hemmings-row; the prisoners were gone when I found him on the ground; I cannot say at what time he lost his watch: when the third man ran away the prisoners were in Pall Mall east - I was in the middle of the waste ground; I wanted to get home, and thought they were gentlemen - I followed, to see if they would put him into a coach.</p>

On the night of the 13th of October, between half-past six and seven o'clock, I saw the two prisoners in Bow-street, together; they stood there a few minutes - two or three more persons were with them; I then saw Cooper and Ward turn into Long-acre, with Allensby and two more men; they all went down St. Martin's-lane, and then down <placeName id="t18281023-228-crimeloc1332">Hemmings-row</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you never lost sight of them from Broad-court till they ran away? A. No; nobody remained with him after Allensby left him - we both got up to him together; Allensby was then running - the prosecutor was very drunk. Allensby had once met me at an anction-room in the Poultry; he struck me, and called me an informer, because I had appeared against Cooper. his comrade.</p>

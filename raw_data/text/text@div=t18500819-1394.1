                  </hi>. I am a labourer, at Southgate. On Sunday night, 28th July, I was drinking with the prisoners at the Crown—I left a few minutes before twelve o'clock, and went towards my master's house—the prisoners came up to me—I spoke to Speering, and said, "James, where are you going?"—he said, "I want your money"—I said, "Do you mean that? I have very little money about me, and I work very hard, and I wont part with it"—he struck me, and then I knocked him down—Rogers then knocked me down, and Speering laid on me while Rogers cut my pocket out with a jack-knife like this(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had a half-sovereign and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—they weut towards the town—I was afraid to follow them—I went into a field and stopped there all night, and went into the village at daylight—I had seen the money at eleven—10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it was wrapped up in an address, which my master had given me to take to America, and the prisoners bet a pot of beer I could not produce another 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I did so, and won the beer—in going to the station Speering said he would give me a little money to go along the road, if I would let him go.</p>

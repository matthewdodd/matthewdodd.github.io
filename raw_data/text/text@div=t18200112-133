I shewed to him, and he took it from me - I did not give him leave to pledge it; I saw him take it into the shop, but did not know what he was going to do with it. When he came out I asked him what he had done with it? He said he had pawned it, but I should soon have it again - I said I could not help it; he took a pair of boots from me without leave. On the 18th of December he took us to the Borough, and said he could get us a ship. He gave us a false pass, and left us there at a public-house at nine o'clock at night; Gurr was with me. Three days before that, he took us to lodge at Marshall's.</p>

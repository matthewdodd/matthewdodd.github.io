The Prosecutor depos'd, That he having been in the Service of Merchant Forward, had been to receive his Money for the Voyage; and as he was going in Stepney Fields, near the Half-way House, met with the Prisoner, who ask'd him to spend a Penny with her, that thereupon he went in to the Yard of the Half-way-House with her, and far down in one of the Boxes, where they drank a Pot of Drink, and a Bottle and Pint; that he taking out his Pouch, where in were both his Tobacco and Money, to fill a Pipe, the Prisoner had the Opportunity of seeing his Gold, that having fill'd his Pipe he put his Pouch again into his Pocket; and having stay'd there drinking with the Prisoner about Half an Hour, he paid the Reckoning, having other Money in his Pocket, and came away, the Prisoner going out of the Door that was towards London, and he at that towards Stepney; and in a Minute's Time feeling for his Pouch, miss'd it, and returned back immediately, but could not get sight of her; but enquiring of the People of the House, had an Account of her, but could never light on her till a Month after, that he heard she was committed to New Prison for another Fact. He was positive the Prisoner must take his Pouch and Money, he being at that Time very sober, and there being no Person in this Company but the Prisoner, who sat by him in the Box, tho' he had no Familiarity with her, but in the way of Talk and Drinking together, thinking it to be an Act of Charity to give her a Pot of Drink, and that he did not so much as kiss her Lips, nor feel her any where at all, while they were together, but he did suppose she took the Pouch as they were rising up to go away. The Prisoner's Defence was, That as she was going along the Back Lane from Rag Fair, with a Basket of Oysters, the Prosecutor took her hold by her Arm, telling her, she was very like a young Woman whom he Courted seven Years ago, and would have had her gone in with him no drink at the Sign of the Ship, but she refus'd; that he still went along with her, and offer'd her two Shillings to let him lie with her, but she would not consent to any such Thing, upon which the Prosecutor abus'd her, and threw down her Basket of Oysters, calling her Names, telling her he had been with a Bitch that had robb'd him of his Money; and if she would not let him he with her, he would swear the Robbery to her. But the Prosecutor deny'd all she said, and that she had any Oysters or Basket either. She not being able to give any Proof of what she said, or to call any one Person to her Reputation, the Jury found her <rs id="t17231016-54-verdict286" type="verdictDescription">

On Saturday, the 4th of August, between eight and nine at night, I saw a man come in my shop, he took something off the counter, I could not see what it was; he was pursued. I did not know what I was robbed of until the hats were brought back.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SHONE. On the 4th of August I was in Mrs. Wallis's parlour in conversation with her; I saw some person go out of the shop with some straw bonnets; he was at the door when I saw him; I pursued him and overtook him, he was walking, with two bonnets in one hand and one in the other; I tapped him on the shoulder, and begged that he would walk back with me with those bonnets. When I took hold of him he gave me a violent blow on the cheek, and threw the bonnets, at me; about a minute I was insensible from the blow. I ordered my apprentice to take the bonnets up; I pursued him into Princes-street, he was entangled there by the posts; he said, b - r you, I will stick a knife in your b - y guts. I stopped, and called out, stop thief; he then ran, and I moved on behind him at a distance; a watchman coming by and a woman was knocked down; he ran into Queen-street, I collared him, I never lost sight of him, I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

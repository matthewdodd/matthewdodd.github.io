                  </hi>. I am the wife of Solomon Benjamin. We keep a clothes-shop in White-cross-street. On the 20th of November, the two prisoners came to our shop with another person—I came from my back-parlour, where I was washing my child—I saw the prisoners leaning in front of the counter—they said they wanted a coat—I asked what price they would go to—they said about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I thought I had one somewhere, and was going to look for it; but I saw them whisper, and would not take my eye off them—I then said, "If you will call again, my son will show it you"—they then <hi rend="italic">brushed</hi> off—I went behind the counter, and saw the till moved half out, and I missed out of it a sovereign and 2 half-crowns—I had put 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there just before, to pay a bill, and no one had come in but the prisoners, and the boy who was with them—I ran after them, but they were out of sight—I gave an alarm to the officer, and returned to my own door—in about three quarters of an hour, the policeman took these two prisoners—I know they are the two who were in the shop.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner with two others, following two gentlemen (one of them was smaller than himself) - they were following Mr. Malloney, and trying his pocket; they went a little further, and tried again, and then went into the road - they went back into Dudley-court. I took hold of the prisoner, and took the handkerchief from his bosom - I made him run along with me, and overtook Mr. Malloney; I asked if he had lost any thing - he said yes, a handkerchief, and claimed this.</p>

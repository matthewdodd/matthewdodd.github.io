On the 15th of April I was in the parlour behind the shop- the two prisoners came in between eight and nine o'clock: the lad rang the bell, and said they wanted stays, which it is customary for a female to show - I went and saw them near the counter; I saw Sullivan take something off the counter - I went behind them, and saw something under each of their arms, but could not see what it was; a customer came in, whom I told my lad to attend to, and I would attend to the prisoners - they then asked for some caps, which I showed them; they did not like them, but said they would call another day - when they had left the shop I missed some lace, and sent the boy after them; he brought back Sullivan, and I told her what I suspected; she said I was wrong - she had done nothing: I sent my lad for Howitt - she came back, and I charged her with it- while I was talking with her she dropped a card of lace into a chair; I sent for an officer: before he came Sullivan begged me to forgive them - I said I could not, and took them into the room; when the officer came he found a pair of stays in Howitt's hand, and two pairs of French gloves, which they said they had bought in the City; the stays were not mine - they belonged to a person named Lee; the lace was mine.</p>

            . I am a waiter to Messrs. Benson and Miles. On the morning of the 27th of September I was apprised by my fellow servant that Bond, the prisoner, had taken a ham, and emptied it into the dust cart. I went to the cart, and there I found the ham covered with dust. I took it out of the cart, and brought it into the coffee-room. I then secured the cellar window and the top cellar door, and kept them in the cellar. I then sent my fellow servant to call my master up, and I went for an officer.</p>

            . I am cellerman to Messrs. Benson and Miles. On Monday morning the dustmen came between six and seven. In the course of some little time afterwards I perceived the prisoner, Bond, empty the basket in a suspicious kind of a way; he threw the basket down with his left hand, and covered the dust over with his right, which made me suspect that master had lost something, I acquainted my fellow servant of it. I went down in the cellar and counted the hams; I missed one. I saw the ham after it was brought back; it was my masters by the appearance and by the size; it had got no mark on it. I am sure the the prisoner, Hill, did not see it put into the cart, nor was he there when the ham was put into the basket.</p>

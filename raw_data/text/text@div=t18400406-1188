                  </hi>. I am a widow. In August last the prisoner lodged in the same house with me in Boston-street, Dorset-street—there were two beds in the room—I and another person occupied one bed, the prisoner and another person the other—she lodged there six days, and one day she sent me to buy a cake for tea—I was absent about a quarter of an hour, and when I returned she was gone—I missed a pair of stays, a petticoat, and a gown—she did not return to the lodging—nobody could have taken the things but her—I left her in my room taking care of it—she hired the lodging of me by the week, and left me the day before her week was due—my things were all safe when I went out—I have never seen any of them since.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodged in the same room. When I went up stairs my aunt desired me to ask Mrs. Chandler if she knew a person who would purchase two frocks—before she could give any answer, the prisoner said she knew a person who had twins that they would just suit—I left them with her, and she left the lodging in the way that has been described, and never returned—these are the frocks—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they belong to my aunt, who is the wife of John Thrustle.</p>

In September, I and my husband went into Staffordshire for three weeks, and left Clay, one of our lodgers, to receive the rents. When I returned the property was gone, and Susannah in custody.</p>

            . I lodge in this house, and was left to collect the rents; the prisoners paid none; on the 10th of September, I went to the room to ask the female prisoner to nurse my child; I knocked at the door - nobody answered - I opened the door, went in, and found all the clothes gone off the bed, and other things gone: the woman returned in the course of the morning, and said she knew nothing about them, but wished to go to her husband, who, she said, was at a public-house. I wished her to look at the room, and when she got there she said I need not be uneasy - that they wanted money, and they should be replaced in the evening; we could not find the husband - he did not return, but was taken in about three weeks - the property has not been found.</p>

We went out to look for work; I got a job at Hendon; I received my wages late at night, and did not like to go home; on Sunday I met a man, who said my wife was in custody. I was employed working at a garden for three weeks, and know nothing of the things.</p>

               <p>SARAH CLAY. I missed the things on Saturday; the 10th of September - the man was at the house on Friday.</p>

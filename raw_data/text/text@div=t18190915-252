            , and inquired if I had a coach to hire? I shewed him one, he objected to the lining, he wished for a blue lining - I showed him one, but he preferred the first, and said he wanted it for five months - I said it would be eight guineas a month; he was to come for it at eight o'clock next morning. I asked him who it was for? he said,</p>
               <p>"For Mr. 
               <persName id="t18190915-252-person2145">Concannon, M. P.</persName>
            , No. 63, York-buildings, New-road." I asked what place he was member for? he said he did not know. I found in the list there was such a member, which satisfied me. He came a little before six o'clock next morning, with a black horse - I asked whose horse it was? he said Mr. Vernon's. I said,</p>
               <p>"What, Vernon's, of Bond-street?" he said Yes. He said he had engaged a coach-house in Dorset-mews West for it, because it would be near to the house. He suddenly changed the conversation, and talked about a bitch which was in the shop - I delivered him the coach. Suspicion crossed my mind immediately after; I went to Vernon's, made inquiry, and then went to look for the carriage. I could neither find Mr. Concannon, nor such a number as 63, York-buildings. I went to Dorset-mews, and found the carriage. While I was talking to Hill Fitt came in, Hill pointed him out to me. I asked him if he had not brought a carriage into the mews that morning? he said he had. I asked him where he put it? he opened the coach-house door. I asked him how he obtained it? he said a friend of his met him in the street, and desired him to bring it there and put it into the coach-house. He said he was informed it was for sale, and a man was coming at ten o'clock to buy it. I said he must go with me to find his friend - he hesitated, and said he would find him, and let me know. I said I must go with him, and unless he found him, and satisfied me respecting his own conduct, he would be prosecuted himself - I got an officer. Fitt led us to Chandler's stables in Great York-mews, where we took Dunton. As we were taking him to the watch-house, Fitt went a few steps with us, and said,</p>

               <p>"I may go now" - I desired the constable to detain him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You delivered the carriage to Dunton - A. Yes. Fitt was bailed before the Magistrate, and attended the next day.</p>

On the 8th of September Dunton desired me to call him at five o'clock in the morning, if I was up - Fitt came to the stable about half-past five, and asked for Joseph - I said it was too soon for him, he went out of the yard directly; his horse did not stand in that mews.

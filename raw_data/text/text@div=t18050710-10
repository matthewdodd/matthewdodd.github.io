             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are clerk to Messrs. Pengree, Grenfell, and Granville? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you for some time past known the prisoner at the bar? - A. About a twelvemonth past.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is he? - A. A <rs id="t18050710-10-deflabel66" type="occupation">brazier</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18050710-10-defend142 t18050710-10-deflabel66"></join>, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he come to Messrs. Pengree and Grenfell for this last twelvemonth past? - A. Yes, he has been in the habit of coming there about four times a week.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. To purchase copper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you remember his coming there on Saturday, the 15th of June? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing you had before observed, did you conceal yourself that day for the purpose of watching him? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you conceal yourself in a place where he did not see you? - A. It is possible that he might have seen my head.</p>
               <p>Q. You took good care he should not see you? - A. I did; I saw him go to the shelf upon which some copper was placed, and take as much as he could grasp in his hand, and put it underneath his waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any person by to observe him at that time? - A. There was a man in the warehouse, he was employed; the prisoner's back was towards him; he was watching him as well as me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person so employed that the prisoner had reason to believe he was not observing him at the time? - A. Yes; on perceiving this, I went and fetched a constable, his name is Cummins; when I came back with Cummins, the prisoner was in the warehouse; he had got four pounds of copper, which he had looked out by way of purchasing it; I gave charge of him to Cummins; I told him that I had seen him steal the copper, he had it then under his waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the constable search him? - A. He did not give him leave; the prisoner directly put his hands under his waistcoat, and hauled out the copper; he appeared very much agitated; he said it was the first time, and begged that we would forgive him; the copper was put into the hands of the constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were not you at your desk in the warehouse at the time I came in? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. As to your attempting to say you concealed yourself is a falsity? - A. Immediately upon his entering the warehouse, I left it, and went into the place of concealment.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How did you conceal yourself? - A. On the top of the stairs leading to the floor above; I looked over.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It is possible he might have seen you? - A. I do not think he did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had you any reason to think he had robbed you before? - A. I think he had.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a tender question to ask.</p>
               <p>- CUMMINS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. On Saturday, the 15th of June, were you sent by Garland to take the prisoner into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100013"></xptr>Q. Did you find the prisoner there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take any thing out of his waistcoat? - A. Yes, that copper; I produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Garland.) Are these the pieces of copper you saw him put under his waistcoat? - A. These are the pieces of copper that he put under his waistcoat; they are saucepan bottoms, they are worth twenty-eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. They are the property of Messrs. Pengree and Grenfell? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been in the habit of coming to that warehouse upwards of a twelvemonth; I have purchased a great many bottoms exactly as them, and amongst some of them are the bottoms that I have purchased.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Prove it - were they purchased that day? - A. No, that day I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard what the witnesses said - you were seen to take it, and put it under your waistcoat, and the constable saw you take it from under your waistcoat? - A. I have been in the habit of buying at that warehouse a great while; there has been a ton weight sold at that warehouse of pieces of copper, both in shape and size of them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Park-street, Camden<lb></lb>town. On Tuesday the 9th of October, I was engaged to remove some furniture to the Regent's-park—I had a coat on which I hung in the hall—my pocket-book was in the pocket, containing a cheque of £50, which I received from Mr. Alger, in part payment of the work I had done for him—I missed my coat—the cheque was drawn on Praed's bank—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at. it</hi>)—payment was stopped—I wrote my name across the cheque when I received it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Praeds. On Wednesday, the 10th of October, the prisoner came to our banking-house between ten and eleven o'clock, and presented this cheque—I asked him where he brought it from—he said from Mr. Wheeler, of Prince-street, Red Lion-square—we detained him, and sent for an officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman.

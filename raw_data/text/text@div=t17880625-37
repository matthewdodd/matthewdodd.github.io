               <p>I went into the stable to lay down to sleep by my horses, and there was the prisoner concealed under a truss of straw, he said, halloo; I knew the prisoner before, he was <rs id="t17880625-37-deflabel168" type="occupation">horse-keeper</rs>

               <p>Court. Are you sure that the crown that was found in his pocket was yours? - Yes, the prisoner owned it.</p>
               <p>Were any promises made to him to induce him so to do? - No, Sir; there was nothing said, he said he looked upon it to be my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. You said that he looked upon it to be your property, that was what he said? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not he say at the same time that he had found it in the yard? - Yes, not in the yard, he said he found it laying down by me.</p>
               <p>Why do you not tell us all that he said? - Tell it all!</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When the judge asked you just now whether any thing was said; you said, why no, nothing was said to induce him: was not it said that he had better tell the whole story, and no harm should come to him, and that he should not be hurt? - No, Sir, there was nothing said of that sort, there is no harm come of it.</p>
               <p>He told you he found the bag in the stable, and looked upon it to be your property? - Yes, when I first came home he was in the tap-room, he appeared to me to be sober enough.</p>
               <p>Was he sober when you went and took him? - As sober as I am now, and I am sure I am not drunk.</p>
               <p>Was the stable door open the whole time you was there? - The stable door was open, it was not dark.</p>
               <p>Jury. When did the man own he had thrown the bag away in Milk-street? - After he was taken.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the stable? - The Three Cups in Bread-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you known this man? - I cannot say how long, he did live at our house as horse-keeper.</p>

               <p>I went to take the prisoner, I searched him, and found this money in his right-hand breeches-pocket; I put it on the table, and Mr. Ashmore our ward beadle, immediately covered it with his hand; I then asked the prosecutor what pieces of money he had lost; he said a new guinea, a new half-guinea, a crown piece, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250038"></xptr>some half-crowns; the prosecutor owned the crown piece, and said it was a present from his master; I asked the prisoner what he had done with the bag, and he said he threw it away in Milk-street.</p>
               <p>(The money shewn to the court.)</p>

               <p>How many marks on the neck, and how many off? - I cannot say, I cannot say whose quine it is; I cannot read or write, this is the very piece. (Shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Roberts. The prisoner in the watch-house said it was the prosecutor's money, and that he had found it in the straw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Jury. When the prisoner was taken, and the money taken out of his pocket, did the prosecutor describe it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

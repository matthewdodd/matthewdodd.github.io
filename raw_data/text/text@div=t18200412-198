On Tuesday, the 23d of March, in consequence of suspicion, I marked the money in the till about eleven or twelve o'clock in the day, and went out about eight at night; I returned about eleven o'clock - the till was not locked - he was my only shopman. I do not know how much money there was in the till. When I came home he was in bed. I did not charge him with the offence till Wednesday night after he had shut up. I then took him up stairs, and asked him what change he had in his pockets? he said he had only one or two shillings. I asked him if he had not got to the amount of a guinea? he said No. I then said,</p>
               <p>"William, you have been robbing me - I know better," he made no reply. I said,</p>
               <p>"Come, pull it out," and he immediately pulled out 22 s. 6 d. marked, four or five were unmarked. I told him he had increased his stock since last night - he said nothing. There was always sufficient money in the till to give change. On Tuesday night he asked me for 2 s. 6 d., which I owed him, and said he had not got one shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. He sometimes gave the customers change out of his own pocket - A. Never. We had above 16 l. in silver in the till all that day. I sent for the prisoner's father, and allowed him to go away with him, on his father's promise that he should return next day. My loss is above 300 l.</p>

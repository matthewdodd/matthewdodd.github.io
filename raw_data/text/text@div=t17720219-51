I took in a watch as a pledge on the 20th of January; I put it in the window behind the counter; I missed it about eight o'clock that night. The prisoner came with the person that pledged it about three o'clock in the afternoon; about two hours after that the prisoner came to know if I would buy the watch that was pledged by the other person; I said, I would not. I missed it about an hour after he was gone; I made enquiry about it the next day, and found it at Mr. Davidson's at Temple Bar. I paid the money lent upon it, which was 15 s. and took it away. The prisoner went there afterwards for the watch, and they stopt him and sent for me; that was the Friday after I lost it.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Davidson's, a pawnbroker; the prisoner brought this watch on Tuesday the 21st of January; I lent him 15 s. Two hours after that, Marsh came and described the watch, and my master delivered it to him. The prisoner came on the 31st with a duplicate and two other persons, and demanded the watch. We secured him, and took him to the Compter; we informed Mr. Marsh of it, and we had afterwards a hearing before my Lord Mayor.</p>

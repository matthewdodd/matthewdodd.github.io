                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. On the 22nd of March I went with Collier to the male prisoner's residence, at No. 26, Woods-mews, Park-lane—I found him at home, and told him I was come to search his lodgings, if he would consent—he said he had no objection—I searched his bed-room, there was a very large box there—I found this table-cloth's it—the box was locked—he took the key and unlocked it for us—I found this sword in the same box, and a variety of towels, table cloths, silk hand<lb></lb>kerchief, seven pairs of sheets, and this counterpane—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—then is a great deal more—here are towels, printed cotton, and a variety of other things, and a great quantity of carpeting—I searched other boxes, and found other things—I asked where he got the sword from—he said he had it given him when he was in Ireland by a butler in France, named Le Maitre—I asked him about this large table-cloth—he said Mary his wife knew about that—his wife came in while I was searching, and I asked her if she knew any thing about that table-cloth—she said Mrs. Clarke, Earl Charlemont's housekeeper in Dublin, gave it her—I showed her his Lordship's coat of arms on it, and asked her what she would say to that—she said it would be the ruin of both of them—her husband was in the other room—I do not think he heard her—the next day I took both the prisoenrs into cus<lb></lb>tody—several things had been marked, and the marks erased—here is a napkin with the mark picked out, and upon this, in another corner, the ini<lb></lb>tials of the prisoner's are worked.</p>

Mary Dobie lived in his service up to the 23rd of March—his lordship was then in Ireland, but the family were living in Lower Grosve-nor-street—Earl Charlemont had horn cups like these, and two have been missed—they were found in another box at the male prisoner's.</p>

                  </hi>. I was butler to Earl Charlemont last February. I left the first week in March—I know this sword—I cleaned it some time after Christmas, and greased it, and gave it to Mary Dobie, and told her to take it to his lordship's room, as my cupboard was rather damp—I knew Le Maitre, I succeeded him—he left the service last July, more than six months before I had given Mary Dobie the sword to take care of—I had it in my possession from July, till I gave it her.</p>

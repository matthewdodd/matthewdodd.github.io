                  </hi>. I live in Stafford-place, Pimlico. On the evening of the 7th of May, I was on Holborn-bridge—I felt a tug, and on turning round, I saw the prisoner close behind me—I think there was another with him, but I kept my eye on the prisoner—he crossed the road into Farringdon-street, and I followed him—on the way I met an officer—the prisoner turned into Farringdon-market—I went and challenged him with taking my handkerchief—he said I was mistaken, it was not him—I said I was certain it was—I turned his coat aside, and found it in his coat pocket—I did not at the time recollect that there was my mark upon it, but since then, I have remembered that the print had run in the washing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer.

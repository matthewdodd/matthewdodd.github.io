            . I am the wife of William Sparrow. On the 6th of May, I met the prisoner, who was a stranger; I had a bundle and a basket - she asked if I would allow her to carry the bundle; I said Yes - I gave her the bundle and we went to my room in <placeName id="t18280529-123-crimeloc680">East Smithfield</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. I was coming from my work and she was buying a whole lot of old things in Rosemary-lane; she gave 10s. for them, and tied them up in her apron - I said to her "That is a heavy load for you to carry, where do you live? if it is in my road, I will take it for you;" she said she would thank me, and we went to the house: she opened the door - I went into the room; she opened the things and washed them all while I sat there - I said "If you please, give me a cup of water;" she turned to get it, and I never moved off the chair till I came out: whether the cloth was on the chair or not, I do not know - she begged me to come again, and in about half an hour I was taken by her in Rosemary-lane.</p>

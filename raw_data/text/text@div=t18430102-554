                  </hi>. I am one of the vergers of St. Paul's. In April I had a horse and gig which I wanted to dispose of—I advertised it—on the 12th of April the prisoner called on me at No. 5, Amen-corner—he said, "I have heard you have got a horse and gig to dispose of, and I think, from the de<lb></lb>scription I have heard, it will suit me, if you will bring it"—he felt in his pocket for his card-case, and had not got it—he said, "By the bye, I have got a direction on the back of a letter which I received a few days since, and if you will come to No. 14, Fludyer-street, I think I shall be a purchaser of your horse and chaise"—this is the back of the letter—there is "Mr. Thomas Cook, 14, Fludyer-street, Whitehall" on it—I went the next morning to No. 14, Fludyer-street—I knocked at the door, and found the prisoner in the house—I invited him to get into the gig by the side of me, to drive the horse round, to see that he was all right and sound—he got in, and we drove round, and came back to No. 14, Fludyer-street—when we got back he said, "You must get out, and come to the parlour; I wish to speak to you there"—he then said, "I like the horse very well, what do you want for it?"—I said, fifty-five guineas—he said, "I think that is more than it is worth, what is the lowest you will take?"—I told him I would take fifty guineas—he said, "I will give you fifty guineas for it, provided you will take a bill for seven days"—I said I could not think of taking a bill, it was not a regular way of doing bu<lb></lb>siness for a thing of that kind—(I had never known him before)—he offered to give me a bill for seven days, drawn on Masterman and Peters—I refused to take</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in Great Marlborough-street. I am agent to Sir Samuel Fludyer—Mr. Burrows holds the house No. 14, Fludyer-street—I have the agreement for it in my hand—the prisoner never was the holder of it—there is no other agent for Sir Samuel Fludyer but my<lb></lb>self in London.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Sharp, I was in his shop at the time it was stole. On my coming to the door I was told that the woman had taken it; I ran after her directly and took it away from her. Mr. Blake came up and I gave it to him. She had the gingham in her hand.</p>
               <p>- JOHNSON. I am an hosier. I was standing at the door when the young man announced to me there was a robbery at Mr. Sharp's. Upon my approaching the prisoner, I took the gingham from the young man, for him to secure the prisoner; I then took the gingham to my own warehouse and deliver- it to the constable.</p>

I was going along Cheapside, I picked that cotton up, it was twenty yards from that shop; the lad came up to me, he said my good mistress that piece of gingham belongs to our shop; I said if it is yours take it. That young man came up and said I should not go, he would charge an officer with me. I had the cloth in my hand; I did not cover it with any thing.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Elizabeth Hack.) You said you saw her take it. - A. I saw her take it; I will be upon my oath that she took it from the side of the door.</p>

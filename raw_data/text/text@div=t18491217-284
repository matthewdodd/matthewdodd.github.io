I am M'Donald's mother—I recollect Wednesday, 28th Nov.—my son was taken into custody on the Thursday—on the Wednesday night he came home about a quarter or half. past eleven o'clock; he then had his supper, and went to bed; I am certain he went to bed; he put off his clothes in my kitchen—he took the candle and called me to take the light—I took up his coat, and put it on the bed—he left his shoes, and could not find them, for I put them in a cupboard till I came down next morning—at half-past six the next morning a person came with a double knock at the door, and asked if my son was at home—I said "Yes," asked him in, and called my son—I saw the party, and heard the voice—I cannot say whether I have heard the voice since—I could not swear whether any of the parties at the bar look like that party—I asked my son if he should be in to breakfast—he said he would—I came down and gave him his shoes, and he took his coat and handkerchief, and went out—it was not light enough for me to distinguish the party who came for him—my son had a situation in the Bricklayers' Arms—he has been usually em<lb></lb>ployed there.</p>

I keep the Bell-inn, at Peckham, in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell—I have a skittle-ground on my pre<lb></lb>mises, the gutters of it were lead; they were fixed to the building. On the 6th of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I missed some of this lead—I had seen it safe about twelve the day before—the prisoner lived in a house adjoining the back of my premises—some lead was shown to me the same evening, which I believe to be mine—I was present when it was compared with what remained—it fitted exactly—it was cut off in little pieces.</p>

About half-past ten o'clock, on the 6th of May, I stopped the prisoner at Peckham, and took out of his breeches' pocket these two pieces of lead, and these other pieces from his jacket pocket—he was about 300 yards from the prosecutor's premises-I took him to the prosecutor's, and matched the lead the next morning to the roof of the skittle-ground—the remains of it were still fixed—it exactly fitted to what remained—I compared the prisoner's shoes with some foot-marks which I found in the prosecutor's garden—they corresponded ex<lb></lb>actly—they were about ten yards from the premises—part of the tips of the shoes were off and they were a good deal <hi rend="italic">cocked</hi> on one side.</p>

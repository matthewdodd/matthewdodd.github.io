            . I live at No. 152, Houndsditch. On the 15th of June, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner (I believe him to be the man) offered forty-two hats for sale, he had them in a bag. I gave him 10 d. each for them; they were new. It is a general price for common felt hats. They were in a rough state - they are very common felt. He was about ten minutes with me. I did not particularly notice him. I asked him who sent him to me - he said he brought them from a person opposite Whitechapel-church, I did not ask the name. I have very little doubt of his being the man.</p>

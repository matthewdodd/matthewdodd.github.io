            . I live with the linen-draper - my master gave me the care of the chaise; two men came by, and the prisoner, who was one of them, took the coat and ran away with it - he was in the road; I followed him, and he threw the coat away at the end of the square - I still followed, and he was taken in Green-street; he begged to be let go, as he said he took it from poverty, and two soldiers who then had him, let him go - I went up to him, and he said it was for want; he ran on, and I followed him again - the Policeman took him in St. Martin's-lane; I had lost sight of him, but I swear he took it.</p>

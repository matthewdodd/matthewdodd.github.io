               <p>WILLIAM BATES. I am shopman on Holborn-bridge. I was standing at my employer's door, and saw the prisoner in company with another young man; the prosecutor was about two yards before them - I saw the prisoner's companion go up to the prosecutor, and saw both his hands upon his pocket; he drew the handkerchief out, and gave it to the prisoner, who concealed it under his coat; I immediately ran across the road, secured the prisoner, and told Mr. Heale; he asked the prisoner for his handkerchief, and he delivered it up to him; his companion ran down Field-lane.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BONUS. I received him in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

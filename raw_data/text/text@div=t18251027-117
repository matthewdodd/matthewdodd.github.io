            , the labourer. My master had given me orders to go the night before; Cronin drove the cart; I did not know where we were to go - we went about a quarter before five o'clock into Downing-street, and turned round to the right into the stable-yard - there were some old bricks about the yard, and some new ones placed up; we found Butcher, Aldsworth, and Kelly there - they told us to throw up the bricks, and helped us to do so; the cart was then driven to my master's cellar in Gardener's-lane, and the bricks shot in there; I had got the key of Adams; I left Thomas Ball in the cellar; I gave the key to Handley the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What time was this? A. About five o'clock. I saw some old bricks and some new ones piled up; the cart was loaded with old bats, (which are broken bricks,) from houses that are pulled down - there were some whole bricks among them - it was Kelly who told us to load them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Does not your master boy a great quantity of old and new bricks? A. Yes; the cellar is his general depository for all his building materials - I could not have distinguished these bricks from others.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Margaret, Westminster. On the morning of the 12th of October, I was on duty in Downing-street; the Treasury yard is in my beat; there are a number of bricks there; I saw the cart on the Tuesday, and on the Wednesday morning, about five o'clock, it drove into the Treasury yard empty; a man, named Ball, drove it; Butcher, Aldsworth and Wingate were with it; Kelly was in the yard; I do not know Cronin by name - I know Mr. Brown's carman; the cart staid in the yard about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; it was backed against some old bricks, and they began to load; I did not see Aldsworth do any thing - he is foreman there - Butcher assisted to load the cart with Kelly; I stood by the side; I thought every thing was right, seeing the foreman there - I gave some information on a former occasion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are you confining your statement to what happened on Wednesday, the 12th of October? A. Yes; the Treasury watchman was not there; it was Cronin who drove the cart - I was mistaken in saying it was Ball - Kelly was the principal person who loaded it - he was a private watchman at the house of Mr. Delaney, of Downing-street, and went with the cart to the yard - Butcher helped to heave the bricks into the cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the Treasury watchman's name? A. Ford; he leaves about five o'clock; the business begins about ten minutes afterwards; the parish watchman goes at six o'clock. I have often known persons to come to work as early as five or ten minutes after five o'clock.</p>
               <p>JAMES BROWN. I am a builder - my workshops are in Gardener's-lane, opposite to Mr. Adams'. I have often lent him my cart. On the morning of the 12th of October, I was going home from the watch-house, being a constable, and saw my cart in King-street - Cronin was driving; it went into Gardener's-lane; I believe it had bricks and bats in it - they were put down, and I saw Wingate throwing them into the cellar - it is a narrow street, not above twelve feet wide - I cannot swear there were any whole bricks in it.</p>
               <p>EDWARD CROCKER re-examined. Q. Is Kelly a labourer? A. Yes; he is also employed as a watchman at a house the back part of which is pulled down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What becomes of the old bricks? A. They are used in the work, and when the work is done, what have not been used will be sold by auction.</p>

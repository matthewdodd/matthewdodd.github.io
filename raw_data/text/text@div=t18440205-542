               <p>o'clock on the stand on Dowgate-hill, with his cart, not going to the St. Katha<lb></lb>rine's Docks—there had been some inquiries made of me by Messrs.

Fincham and Co., in consequence of which I went again to the prisoner Hurcam, and found him in the Three Crowns, Dowgate-hill—I inquired again respecting the coffees, where they were, and what really were delivered—he said he had delivered the order back to Messrs. Fincham—I said, "If you had not got the coffee, you ought to have delivered the warrant back to me"—I then went back to Messrs. Fincham to inquire for the warrant—I did not find the warrant or goods there—next morning I went to St. Katharine's Docks—in consequence of what I heard there, I pro<lb></lb>cured a constable, and gave Hurcam into custody—he said he knew nothing about the coffee, that it was taken away by some one—I afterwards gave directions to have Reeves taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner Hurcam's brother. On Saturday evening I had two carts ordered for nine o'clock on Monday morning, at Messrs. Green and Son, stationers, No. 83, Queen-street—I do their carting—I sent the prisoner there at nine on the Monday morning—I did not go with him, but at ten minutes past nine I saw him there, standing at the tail of his cart, loading; and at half-past nine I saw him there; and again at ten minutes or a quarter to ten, I cannot say to a few minutes—after ten I saw him cross<lb></lb>ing Moorgate-street with his cart loaded, as I had occasion to go to St. John's-gate for orders—he was driving.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you the man whose cart was called for by Cove, because his own were engaged on Saturday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have known Reeves a year or two perhaps—I am not in the habit of employing him—he has worked for me, not within the last three or four weeks, not regularly, but occasionally, if I could not get anybody else—I have "William Hurcam" on my carts—I was before the Magistrate when my brother was being ex<lb></lb>amined on this case—I was once tried myself for stealing some beans, or something like that—I went about my business after the trial—I was not convicted that I know of—I was found guilty not exactly of stealing the beans, but of knowing the party that did steal them—they put me where I saw some. people better than myself, and some worse, in a country house where a good many gentlemen live, near Brixton—I was not put on the treadmill, they kept me in better quarters, because I was a better sort I suppose—I was in solitary confinement a little while.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bethnal-green, and work at Messrs. Green and Son's, 83, Queen-street. On Monday, the 15th of Jan., the prisoner Hurcam brought a cart to our door at nine o'clock, and continued there till ten minutes past ten—I loaded the cart, and sent him with a load of paper to the City-road—he came there for that purpose.</p>

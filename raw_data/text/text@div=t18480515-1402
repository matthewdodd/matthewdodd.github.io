                  </hi> I am wife of William Leigh, of No. 8, Ordnance-row, Lewisham-lane, in the parish of Lewisham. I keep a greengrocer's shop—on Sunday 20th Feb., about two o'clock. I left home to go to a funeral, leaving my husband at home—I returned at half-past eight, found the door closed and waited for my husband—he came in five or six minutes with the key, and tried to unlock the shop door, but could not—we went to the private door, it was wide open—we went in, and went down the kitchen steps at the back of the house—the kitchen door was wide open, the shutters down, the window open, and the drawers also—I found both bed rooms strewed with linen and other articles, and the landing also—the drawers were all opened and emptied—I missed two silver watches, a silver milk-jug, twenty spoons, a blue and white silk handkerchief, and other articles—these are the watches and handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I hemmed this handkerchief with ravelling—it is my husband's.</p>

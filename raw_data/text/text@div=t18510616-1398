                  </hi>. I am a clerk On 28th May, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing along Waterloo-road, by the end of Granby-street—I saw a crowd, and some persons engaged in, what appeared to me to be, a sham fight—Bryant was one of the men; I do not know the other; it was not one of the other prisoners—I stood for a few minutes looking, and Bryant came to me, and said, "You see how he is using me"—two other men came to me, one on each side, and they held me, and Bryant came in front of me, and took my watch out of my waistcoat-pocket; it was attached to a guard; he unscrewed the swivel, and took the watch away—that was all done while the other men were holding me—there were other persons round me—I did not see either of the other prisoners—when Bryant took the watch, he walked sway two or three yards—the men who had held me let me go, and I followed Bryant down Granby-street for two or three yards; he turned round, and when he turned again, I saw the policeman—I had not lost sight of Bryant; I gave him into custody, charged him with stealing the watch—the policeman took him to the station—in going along the policeman was knocked down—I did not see either of the other two prisoners there—my watch was silver—I have not got it again—I saw it in Bryant's hand.</p>

               <p>the prosecutor gave Bryant into my custody, and charged him with stealing his watch—Bryant said he had not got the watch, and knew nothing of it—as I was going to the station, I was thrown down by Adams—before I wag thrown down, I saw Fardell beckon to Adams—that was in Grove-place—Adams came up and stopped me, and the mob surrounded me—Adams threw me down; I still kept hold of Bryant, and when I got up, I saw Fardell and Payne at the back of Bryant; they had hold of him by the hand or the coat, they were close to him—I took Bryant to the station, the others went away.</p>

I had seen the prosecutor at my house before this transaction—About 3 o'clock that afternoon I saw a mob in Granby-street—there was a sham fight going on with Bryant and another man—I got up there, and I saw Fardell and Payne—the prosecutor was near the end of Granby-street, in Waterloo-road—he was with Bryant—I did not see the other prisoners after the fight—I saw Bryant walk away, followed by the prosecutor, who gave him in charge—before the officer came up, Bryant had his hand in his bosom—after the officer took Bryant, I saw Fardell walk by Bryant's side—I saw Adams throw the officer down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Oldham, we live at 5, Grove-place. Last Wednesday three weeks, I saw the policeman with Bryant in custody—Adams came up, and threw the policeman down—I saw Fardell and Payne behind Bryant, and Bryant took something from his bosom, and passed his hand behind—their hands were all in motion—I did not see what became of it; but I heard Fardell say to Adams, "Is it right?" and he said, "A watch"—and he said either "Safe and gone," or "Passed and gone"—some woman then pulled Adams into a house.</p>

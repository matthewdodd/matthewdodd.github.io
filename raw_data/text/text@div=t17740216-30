            . On the 7th of February as I was sitting in the room next my shop, I heard the glass of my window break; I saw somebody run away; the person continued running; I pursued him; I overtook him, and brought him back again; my maid took up the things.</p>

            . I was in the kitchen; I heard the glass break; I came up to see if my master had catched the person. I picked up the handkerchiefs: seven linen and one silk and cotton one.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw the things about an hour before in my window; part of the glass of the window was broke before, and for that reason I was afraid if the handkerchiefs were laid separate they might be drawn out one by one; thinking to prevent that, I tied them up in that bundle, which was too big to take out unless they broke the glass. (The prosecutor deposed to the things).</p>

            . I had passed by the shop; I heard the glass break; I turned round; the prisoner came running towards me; I said you rascal, what have you done there; he then threw the bundle down; somebody took it up; I verily believe those are the same handkerchiefs; they were tied up with a string in that manner.</p>

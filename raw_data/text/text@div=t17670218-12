            . I live in Bartholomew-close with my mother; I am a cloth-worker. Last Monday three weeks, the piece of cloth mentioned was taken away; the prisoner at the bar was stopped with it; I was before Justice Welch when he and the cloth was; he there confessed he took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Justice say to induce him to confess it?</p>
               <p>Vanderplank. I think he said it would be better for him.</p>

            . We had the cloth in our house, I work with Mrs. Vanderplank; I heard the prisoner own before the Justice, he came in at the gate and took it away. I believe the Justice said it would be the better for him to confess.</p>

            . On Monday the 20th of January, I had a piece of cloth offered to me to dispose of by the prisoner; I am a salesman and draper; I apprehended it to be dishonestly come by; I sent for a constable, and charged the prisoner; during the discourse before Mr. Welch, the prisoner prevaricated; I believe the Justice might say, he had better tell the truth; his prevaricating confirmed the Justice and me too, he did not come honestly by the goods: I believe the Justice thought, by means of this man he might come at farther light; perhaps he thought there might be other people concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. What arguments did he make use of; did he say it would be better for him?</p>
               <p>Vigers. I will not take upon me to say that; but he advised him to discover. I do not remember that the Justice said it would be better for him to confess.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to you when he brought the piece of cloth?</p>
               <p>Vigers. He said it was his own. and that he was the manufacturer of it; I suspected him, by his asking a price considerably under the value; he allowed it for 8 s. a yard; it was worth more; if it was taken on my judgement, I would have given three or four shillings a yard more; he discovered to me he had no knowledge of the business, so as to manufacture the cloth, by the discourse I had with him; this also increased my suspicion; when before the Justice, he did acknowledge he went in to Mrs. Vanderplank's house on the Saturday evening, and took out his cloth.</p>
               <p>Vanderplank. I think he said he waited an opportunity, and went in at the gate on a Sunday evening, and took it out; (the cloth produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Gardner. I think he said he went in on the Sunday night, last Sunday was three weeks.</p>

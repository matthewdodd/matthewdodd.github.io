                  </hi> I am a licensed victualler, but have been out of business three weeks—I live at Hoxton. On Sunday night, 13th Feb., between eleven and twelve o'clock, I met the prisoner in Shoreditch—she asked me several times to treat her to something to drink—to get rid of her I gave her a glass of gin at a house in Shoreditch, and I had three halfpenny-worth—I did not take out my purse—I went away towards home—when I got into Old-street I turned round, and saw her six or eight yards behind me—I did not speak to her, but walked into King-street—she came up, and attempted to lay hold of my private parts, sounded my pocket, tore it down, took my purse, and ran away—I ran after her into Hoxton-square—she passed something to a female, who was waiting there—I was going to follow, and was stopped by two men, who laid hold of my collar—the second woman called "Police!"—a policeman came up—the prisoner never left the spot; she had no chance—I stood close to her with a stick.</p>

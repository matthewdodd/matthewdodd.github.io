               <p>PENNISTON TOPPER. In the first week of May, I do not recollect the day of the week; I was passing along <placeName id="t18130602-15-crimeloc87">Crown-street, Finsbury-square</placeName>

He accosted me with the name of Simmons, or Wiggins, something to that effect; I cannot charge my memory which. The prisoner put himself in a fighting attitude with his thumb to my throat, but not with violence. The other man pushed me with force against the prisoner, and when I came in contact with him, the prisoner took from my person my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of your person - A. I had it in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do it with violence - A. No, he did not; I did not perceive I had lost my property until he left me, he did it so quick; I did not perceive him take it. I missed my watch; from the appearance of the men it struck me that I had lost something. I immediately gave the hue and cry of stop thief. I could have easily have taken the other man, but being pretty positive the prisoner had my property. I conceived it necessary to follow him; and when he found I followed him, I saw him throw it away. I picked it up myself. This is the watch; I am positive it is my watch.</p>

I took the prisoner in custody, and took him to Worship-street office. The prosecutor picked up the watch. In taking the prisoner to the office, I told him he was charged with robbing a gentleman of his watch. He said he should not have taken the watch if he had not been lushey, meaning drunk. I took him to the office; he was committed.</p>

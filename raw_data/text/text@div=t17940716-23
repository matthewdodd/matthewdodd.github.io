As I was calling half past eleven o'clock I heard a noise, I went up and see this man pushing the woman, the prisoner at the bar, down; I asked him the reason? He said, she had got his wife's cloak. As soon as the prisoner missed the cloak from under her, she said, stop that man, for he has got my new cloak; he was willing to go to the watch-house. I asked her then where she came from? and she told me, and said, she was a house keeper; and I took them all to the watch-house; I asked her it she kept a house for any body? She said, no, she kept the house.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160040"></xptr>I saw the prisoner fall when I was about ten yards off. The cloak I took to the watch-house.</p>

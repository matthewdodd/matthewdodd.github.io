On the 21 of April, between two and three o'clock, I saw a young man in Old-street in a blue coat, with a basket and two pigeons - I knew the basket to be my master's; I had left it at home when I went out - the prisoners were with that man - they were all walking together, about one hundred yards from my master's; I followed them through a court, and at the end of the court I saw Charles Moore take the pigeons out of the basket, and put them into his pocket: Samuel was close to him - they then all ran over to the Duke of Gloucester public-house; the prisoners went in there, and the other man went away with the basket. I fetched an officer, but when I returned they were gone - the officer took them that night, and I knew them to be the men. I knew Charles Moore before.</p>

            . I am a journey man silk-dresser. On Monday, the 2d of April, Samuel Moore called on me; I went with him to the Royal Oak, Pitfield-street, Hoxton,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050082"></xptr>and staid till three o'clock; I first saw him just before two - he called on me at Mr. Stanbridge's. I saw Charles at the Royal Oak; they left at three, leaving me there - I was in their company the whole hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you so particular about the hour? A. I afterwards heard this robbery was at half-past two o'clock; I do not know where Castang lives; nobody is here from the Royal Oak - it is two or three hundred yards from the City-road. Sam's wife fetched me to Worship-street, in case I should be wanted; I heard of them being in custody about pigeons; they bore a good character; I never heard of their being in custody before.</p>
               <p>Semuel Moore received a good character.</p>

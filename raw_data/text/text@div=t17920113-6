               <p>On the 29th of December last I was informed I had lost some lead; and I saw, between twelve and three, a quantity of lead was taken off a room which forms a part of my dwelling-house, in <placeName id="t17920113-6-crimeloc33">Bridge-street, Westminster</placeName>

               <p>I met the prisoner, the 28th of December, a little before nine; he had passed me just by Privy-Gardens, coming along; we took him into custody; he had some lead; the next day we saw the prosecutor, and fitted the lead; it appeared to be lately cut, and fitted directly; it is about 29 lb. weight; I do not know the value; I found this knife on him.</p>
               <p>Parrott. I do not know the value.</p>

               <p>I work in St. George's-row, and coming over Westminster-bridge, it was a hard frost, and I picked up this lead, and two men came past; says I, I have picked up a prize; they said it was lead; I said, if you will not take it, I will; so I put it over my shoulder, to take it to St. James's watch-house, to see if any body owned it.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

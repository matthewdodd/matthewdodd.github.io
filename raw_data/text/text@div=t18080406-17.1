               <p>Q. Was there any one behind you. - A. I do not know; I found myself very much entangled with the prisoner at the bar, in the front of me; I immediately clapped my hand upon my pocket, and missed my pocket book; I seized him by the collar immediately, I said I had lost my pocket book, I told him he had got it; I immediately saw the pocket book fly from his hand, into the street, under the horses; at that moment another man rushed in between us and broke my hold of him; I never lost sight of him till he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he running away. - A. He was stopped about two yards off; the coachman of the Clapton coach assisted in getting the papers up, and the pocket book was given into the constable's hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. With whom were you walking with at the time. - A. A young woman of the name of Stevens. I have very little knowledge of her, she had hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear that you saw the pocket book in his hand. - A. No, I saw it go from his hand; the papers were loose.</p>

               <p>HANNAH STEVENS. As I was crossing Fenchurch street a man knocked me on my bosom; he immediately said, I have lost my pocket book; I saw the pocket book; I saw the pocket book under the horses feet; the pocket book was picked up by a little boy, it was given to the captain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. Who was it struck you. - A. The prisoner struck me with his left hand; it nearly shoved me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pocket book throwed away. A. No; I saw the papers scattered about; I carried the pocket book into the tobacconist's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect saying, captain, that is not the man. - A. No.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GOODWIN. I am a post boy; me and Mr. Butler the coachman and his son, were talking together in Gracechurch street, about eight o'clock; I turned round on hearing a noise, I saw the captain holding the man by the collar; immediately the captain gave the coachman the umbrella, I saw the pocket book fly between the captain and the prisoner, and the papers flew on the curb, it was all picked up immediately; as the captain gave the coachman his umbrella, a tall man rushed in between the captain and him, and the captain lost his hold; I catched hold of the prisoner, and held him till the waterman came up and assisted me.</p>

Then I ordered him to go there, to know of her what she had bought of the prisoner. She said she had bought two yards of black shalloon. Then I went there myself, and she produced the shalloon, and said she gave 14 d. a yard for it. (Produced in court.) I brought it home, and compared it with a piece of rattinet, and found it tallied exactly. I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176004160024"></xptr> know at first that it was rattinet, but asked for shalloon. I found four yards of canvas upon the prisoner, also my property. I took her before the justice, where she own'd the taking the rattinet and the canvas, that is, she and Buckland the accomplice together.</p>

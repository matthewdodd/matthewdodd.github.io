I was in the shop about five o'clock; a man came in, and asked for some snuff-boxes - I handed him two or three; he wanted some others, and while I was getting them the prisoner came just in at the door, and said, "Have you bought any? there is another box in the window;" it is a very small shop: I said,</p>
               <p>"That is a very expensive box," and I did not like to let them look at it, but I did at last; the prisoner then said, "There is another, with a castle on it;" I put the other box on the counter, and went to get that - the men then went out, and I missed two boxes; I called my husband, who pursued, and brought the prisoner back; he said, "I was here, but I did not take the boxes."</p>

I was instructed by my sergeant and Mr. Risley to watch one of Risley's fields, at Winchmore-hill, Edmonton—I went there a little before two o'clock in the morning, and placed myself in a tree in the field—I had been there an hour and a half, or more—there were cows in the field—about twenty minutes to four o'clock I saw the prisoner come towards the tree where I was, within six or seven yards of where I stood—he was in his police clothes—he was a policeman at the time, and was on duty near that spot, in the road, about 120 yards from the spot in the field where I saw him—the cows were lying within thirty yards of me—he turned to where the cows laid—he put</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at Winchmore-hill. I have examined these tools—some of them belong to me, and some to my father—this chisel is a mortice chisel—I do not know who that belongs to, but it has been in our shop among my father's tools and mine—I remember having used it myself—it has been left in our shop two or three years—I do not know whose it was, but we used it—since this matter has been investigated I have applied that chisel to work on which I believe I used it, and found it exactly corresponded—we had no other chisel of that size—our shop stands in the yard, and most of the tools were kept there—they might be left about the premises—we missed this plane from two to three years, and this other plane about three weeks—I did not know the chisel was gone—it could not have been taken long without our missing it—it was the only one of the size we had—I know the prisoner, having seen him in the garden of our premises—he has been there to borrow a barrow at times—I remember having seen him there six or nine months ago—I think I have seen him there twice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Winchmore-hill. On the morning in question I was called into Mr. Risley's house, and saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor bleeding very profusely, from a great number of wounds on his head—his hair was so clotted with blood I could not see what was the matter—I cut his hair off, cleared the blood away, and wound several deep wounds, some contused and some incised, and a wound on his arm, which was evidently done with a stab—that made me notice the other wounds more particularly—I found some of them evidently done by a some of them evidently done by a cutting instrument—I think five wounds were done by a cutting instrument on his head, besides one on the top of the breast-bone, and one on each fore-arm—three cuts in his face, I think, were done with a cutting instrument, or else with the broken stave—the others were decidedly done with a cutting instrument—this chisel would inflict them—I attended him till he was taken home, about eight o'clock in the morning, and gave him over to the surgeon of the force—two wounds injured his bone, de<lb></lb>nuded the bone on the head, but none of them were to be called dangerous, beyond the concussion they produced at the time, and the consequences which might ensue from inflammation or erysipelas—which might supervene—they were not mortal wounds in themselves—one of them was within one-eighth of an inch of the temporal artery—that was a chisel wound.</p>

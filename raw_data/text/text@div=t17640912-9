            . I am a pawnbroker in Hounsditch: the prisoner at the bar brought this gold watch to me to pawn, on the 25th of July; (Producing it. Deposed to by Prosecutor.) it was in a shagreen case, and he asked ten guineas upon it. I asked him if it was his own? he said, it was. I looked into a book that I keep for advertised watches lost; there I saw it advertised, and the reward to be paid by Mr. Wytick, a watchmaker, at Charing cross. I asked the prisoner who he bought the watch of? he said, he bought it of a Jew, for twelve guineas. I said, that watch is lost, and I shall stop you and the watch too: then I took him to Mr. Wytick's, and Mr. Ferguson was sent for, who owned the watch, and Mr. Wytick said he made it for Mr. Ferguson.</p>

            . This is my watch which I used to wear; I am wife to the prosecutor: when it was missing, the prisoner told me nobody could have it, but another prisoner that was at our house, or his wife: he was very officious, and drew up the advertisement and the bill to go to Goldsmith's hall; the chain cost nine guineas, and he has owned he sold that in the street to a Jew, for about 38 s. I asked him, where he hid the watch, while he was at our house? he said, he had it in a pocket in his breeches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor knows very well, that this prosecution is at the sole expence of my wife's grandfather. It is some time since I married a young lady, against the inclination of her parents: soon after I was married, they took every method to get me separated from her: I was soon arrested, and put into custody: after they could not prevail upon her to leave me, they pretended friendship, I thought, with intention to be reconciled. They got her home, and then sent for part of her goods; she told me, it was their intention to part us; they have offered to send her to France; I well know the influence of her relations: I told my friends of it, and they advised me to decline and leave it: my being carried to the prosecutor's house, was owing to the cruelty of my wife's relations. She had learned music, and there was a harpsichord brought: after that, a bill was brought to me, by order of her friends, to pay for all, for which I was arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. When did the prisoner get released out of custody?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He went to the King's Bench, I believe, about a week or ten days after the watch was lost: he soon got released out of the King's Bench.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He has been a <rs id="t17640912-9-deflabel48" type="occupation">lieutenant in the sea-service</rs>

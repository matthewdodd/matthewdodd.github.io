Lee was my footman and had been so abort a month—he did not suit me, and was to leave on the 28th of May—at five o'clock that morning, he awoke me by knocking at my door—I asked what he wanted—he said the policemen were making some bother down stairs—the policeman, who was on the stairs, called out, "I think there is a robbery in your house"—I put on my dressing gown and ran down—I found the policeman with Lee and the other prisoner in my passage—the officer stated he had seen Ansell leaving my house with a bundle, that he asked him what it was, and he said it contained dirty linen, that he brought him back to my house, and the door was opened by Lee, who said, it was dirty clothes and he had given it him—the policeman said he must see what it was, and he came in and opened the bundle, which contained four bottles of wine—I then asked Lee where he got the wine—he said he bought it in Oxford-street—the officer said to me, "Is it not your wine?"—I looked at it, and said to Lee, "That answer will not do, it is mine, you had better confess at once, and tell me where you got this from"—after some demur, he said, "I took it from your cellar"—I asked him who Ansell was—he said his brother-in-law, and he came to assist him to take away his clothes—Lee's boxes were searched, but nothing was found—I was in the meantime speaking to Ansell, and asked if that was all he had taken—he produced a fifth bottle from his trowsers pocket, which contained brandy—the officer then took them to the station—Ansell made some demur about giving the number of the house he resided at—I said, it would be better to go to his house, and he should show us—we went there and saw his wife, and found three more bottles of wine.</p>

I said, "What have you got?"—he said, "Some dirty linen which I got from my brother"—I said, "Was that your brother that opened the door?"—he said, "Not my brother, but brother-in-law"—I took it from him, opened it, and saw a coat, and four bottles—I took him back to No. 15, and pulled the bell—it was answered by Lee—I asked him if he had given the bundle to this man—he said he had—I asked him where he got the bottles—he said he bought them in Oxford-street—I said I should see his master—he said he was in<lb></lb>disposed in bed, and I could not see him—I took the knocker of the door, and knocked, and he then went up stairs—he was up tome time—I se<lb></lb>cured the hall door, and took the bundle and Ansell with me up stairs—when Lee saw me, he knocked at his master's door, and then some lady asked what was the matter—I said I suspected there was a robbery in the house—Mr. Clifton then came down, and I told him what I had done—he asked Ansell where he got the bundle from—he said from Lee—Lee said he bought the wine in Oxford-street—Mr. Clifton said it was his wine; and that would not do—he then said, "Where have you got it from?"—he said from the cellar—I then went to Lee's bed-room, but found nothing there—when I came down, Mr. Clifton had got another bottle—I went with Ansell to his lodging, and found three more bottles there.</p>

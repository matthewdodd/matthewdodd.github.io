               <p>Q. Did he say how he came possessed of them - A Not a word; I told Mr. Judge that I had a nephew in the business most likely it would suit him; my nephew lives in Silver-street, Golden-square; I took

            . I am an officer of Worship-street-office. On the 13th of June, about two o'clock I, in company with Mr. Gabriel, went to the prisoner's Judge's house, my son and Wilson were with me, Mr. Judge was behind the counter, I asked him if his name was Judge; he said yes; I told him I had a search warrant; I read it, I asked him if he had any sackings; he said yes; I went with him into the warehouse; he said there is two; these are the two, they were laying on the ground. I then asked him if he had any more; he said, yes. We went up stairs over that place, and found five sackings, and a pair of bennets; he said he had no more; Mr. Gabriel asked Mr. Judge if he had sold any in the course of that week; he said six to a bedstead maker in that neighbourhood; I asked Mr. Judge of whom he had bought them; he said he had once bought them of a fresh-coloured woman, but these were brought by a little girl, he gave three shillings and sixpence for them, and he supposed the parties would come again. We secured the goods, and Mr. Judge was taken to the office. All the women that worked for Mr. Gabriel were ordered down to the office that night, but no one was held in custody. On Friday the 14th I went to Mr. Gabriels house, there was this girl with the prisoner Arnott, they, with several of the women that worked there, were ordered to go to the magistrate; from the prisoner Arnott's house I fetched this basket; after that examination had taken place I had a search warrant to search Mr. Barrett's house, Silver-street, Golden-square, when I came there I found Catherine in the shop, I read my warrant to Mr. Barrett, Mr. Gabriel saw some sackings on bedsteads that he knew. Directly afterwards we were led by Catherine and Mr. Barret to a shed next door, I found there one hundred and fifty sackings, they are all here in a cart.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100028"></xptr>They have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at the two first - A. They are my property, we are the only persons supplied in town with cloth of this description from a manufactory in Plymouth; I never saw any like them in my life before. The holes are worked with thrums of sailcloth. I can swear to the property. They sell for six shillings and sixpence wholesale</p>

               <p>Arnott's Defence. I lived servant with the prosecutor's brother four years, and since that I have been employed five years by the prosecutor constantly, and had the care of their house when out of town, and gave the greatest satisfaction, as such I solemnly declare I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Judge's Defence. I had no knowledge whatever of the articles being stolen, nor any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Arnott called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Judge called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

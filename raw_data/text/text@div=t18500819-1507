                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Samuel Howis Castle, of Turnham-green. His furniture was to be sold on Wednesday, 31st July—it was to be seen on the 30th—the prisoner came about one o'clock that day—I went up-stairs with him, and showed him the furniture—I came down with him to the drawing-room—there was a lady there—I saw the prisoner take up a cruet-stand from the drawing-room table—he took this mustard-pot out of the stand, and put the stand down on the table, but not the mustard-pot—there was no mustard in the pot, but there was a silver spoon—he went down<lb></lb>stairs directly—I ran down to the men, who were at dinner in the kitchen, and told what I had seen—Robert Bass ran after the prisoner, and he was brought back—he went down on his hands and knees, and said, if Mr. Castle would let him off, he would try and find the mustard-pot—they went away together, towards the Duke of Devonshire—this is the mustard-pot(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is Mr. Castle's.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the kitchen at Mr. Castle's house—Bricknell came down, and told me something—I ran out of the kitchen, and followed the person she pointed out—I saw him running—he ran through an avenue between two gentlemen's grounds—he ran by the pleasure-grounds of Falkland-house, and into the ✗ain road again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you stop him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; when I found he was gaining ground on me, I called to a person, who went after him, and stopped him on the common—I did not see an omnibus to my knowledge.</p>

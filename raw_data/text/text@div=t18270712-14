I was coming by Angel-alley; I found a crowd, and proceeded up the alley with Sapwell; I saw a quantity of people standing together - I went in among them, and went down the alley; a boy said, "It is is Hearty;" I found the prisoner in the house of one Steele, who keeps a chandler's-shop; he immediately pulled the shawl out from under his jacket; Mrs. Reeve claimed it. He made great resistance, but did not deny it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is altogether false; if you will search his character he has a brother in Newgate now, and I do not think he is any better himself. A man ran up the alley, and dropped the shawl; I picked it up, and went to show it to the man.</p>

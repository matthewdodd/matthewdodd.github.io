            . I saw the prisoner in the shop as I was in the back parlour, and heard the scales rattle - the prisoner had the scales, which he had cut, in one of his hands, and the knife in the other; I asked him why he did it - he said "A pinch of snuff;" I said that was not the way to get it - my husband told him to go out of the shop, and he did; about one o'clock in the morning the Police-man came, and asked if it was the same man - I said Yes; he said he should certainly take him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to ask for a pinch of snuff - I had not 1d. to buy it; I did not take the scales - I lived thirty-three years in Portsmouth, and had not a blemish on my character; I had freehold property to the amount of 3000l.; since the peace I have been reduced.</p>

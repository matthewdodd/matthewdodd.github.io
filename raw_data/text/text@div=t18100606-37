On the 22nd of April the prisoner was charing for me, I set her to clean the kitchen, and told her when she had done to bring me a pail of water into the parlour; she brought me the pail of water, and took out the carpet from the back parlour into the yard, and went out of the back door and never returned; after she was gone I missed, immediately, two one pound notes, two dollars, and 2 s. The prisoner went to sell a pot that she had stole from somewhere else, the person sent to me. I went to the prisoner and asked her where was the money she had robbed me of; she told me that the had got tipsey and lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never found the money since, have you. - A. No; I know she had the money, there was no other person in the place but she and me. I missed the money out of a closet in the kitchen, I had not locked the closet door.</p>

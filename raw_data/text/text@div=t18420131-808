                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you cease to correspond with Mrs. Snow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By her desire—my letters to her were frequent at times—it is quite impossible X can state what number—I have no idea—sometimes they were ten a month, and sometimes not one a month—twenty a month is a good deal more than I can swear to—I cannot swear as to fifteen—I wrote a great many.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, or not, on that occasion express great anxiety about the letters you had written to Mrs. Snow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not—I expressed anxiety for her—I did not express anxiety about my letters, for I re<lb></lb>member saying to the prisoner, "So far as I am concerned, I don't care that for the letters" (<hi rend="italic">snapping his fingers</hi>)—the letters were the subject of conversation, so far as to say that—I certainly did not say that I would not for all the world that any of those letters should fall into the hands of Mr. Snow—no one was present at the dinner—the letters described by the prisoner were from me and others.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you anxious to get up your own letters and the letters of other persons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only by the prisoner telling me that Mrs. Snow wished for them—I was anxious only from what the prisoner said, that Mrs. Snow was anxious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not anxious that the letters should not fall into the hands of Mr. Snow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Merely from that circumstance—I cannot positively say what time the dinner at Long's broke up, but I believe it was about ten o'clock—it began about seven—I think I saw the prisoner between the 20th and 30th of December, but I cannot say positively—he called on me several times at the office, but I do not remember any particular date—he came over to my house at Sydenham on Sunday, the 2nd of Ja<lb></lb>nuary—he did not come there by invitation, that I swear—I was not ap<lb></lb>prised of his intended visit—I do not know exactly at what time he came, but it was before I returned home from church—I found him there on my return from church—he dined with me on that occasion—I dined between the morning and evening services, and he partook of my dinner—I have been a widower between fourteen and fifteen years—my family consists of two daughters and a son—the prisoner had introduced himself to them be<lb></lb>fore I came home—I think he left about three o'clock, or between three and four—Mrs. Snow was the subject of our conversation on that occasion—I have no recollection of the next time I saw the prisoner, but he called on me at the office—he came to Sydenham twice—the second time was on the 16th of January—he dined with me and my family then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, did you on that, or any other occasion, desire the prisoner to wait on Mr. Snow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not, not for any purpose whatever—he told me he was frequently in the habit of seeing Mrs. Snow—I did not on any occasion direct the prisoner to wait on Mr. Snow relative to some provision for Mrs. Snow—my son did not on any occasion accompany the prisoner any where to my knowledge—I have heard my son say he had once been with the prisoner—I believe my son is not here.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your age? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Fifty-three—my eldest daughter is twenty-one, and the other seventeen—some short time since I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any such letters in your possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were let<lb></lb>ters of Mrs. Snow's in my possession, I mean letters belonging to Mrs. Snow—the prisoner never had any opportunity of knowing that fact from me—he never asked me any question about any letters—my sister was not aware that I had got any letters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Robert Snow. I have been married ten years last January—I have two children living—I resided in Portland-place—I left England with Mr. Snow the Utter end of June last,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201310162"></xptr>
               <p>before that, I had been staying with Mr. Snow at Twickenham—I think I went to Twickenham in the latter end of March as well as I can remem<lb></lb>ber—Mr. Snow and I have not lived happily together for some time—while we were on the Continent, those differences resulted in our separation—Mr. Snow came to England in November last, leaving me in Paris—one of my brothers came to Paris, and brought me to England—I am now liv<lb></lb>ing at my father's house in Arlington-street—I have known Mr. Rich, of the War-office, for several years—he has been on intimate terms with my husband and myself, and his daughters also—I remember seeing the pri<lb></lb>soner when he was brought before the Magistrate on this charge—I had never, to my knowledge, seen him in my life before that time—I never authorized or requested him to make any application to Mr. Rich for money to procure letters from my housekeeper—I never authorized him to make any application to Mr. Rich for money on my account under any pretence whatever—I never sent him to Mr. Rich as my friend—I never had any conversation with him in my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you say Mr. Rich was acquainted with yourself and Mr. Snow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he was acquainted with me soon after I married—he is an old friend of Mr. Snow's family—I was in the habit of writing to Mr. Rich, and of receiving answers, often—I cannot exactly say how often, not very often—perhaps oftener than once a month, it might be five times a month—about three times a month I suppose within the last three years—it might have been oftener, yes, perhaps it was sometimes—never ten times a month I should say—I will not say I never received ten letters in a particular month—I dare say I have received and answered ten letters in one month—they came directed to me, by post, and sometimes his daughter brought them when she came to see me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you those letters by you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some of them were left in Port<lb></lb>land-place, and others are destroyed—those that were left in Portland-place were locked up in a drawer, the key of which was left with Mrs. Snow, Mr. Snow's mother, in Saville-row—there were other letters and odd papers in a basket, of no importance, which were also locked up, and the key of that place was in Saville-row—they were left in Saville-row under the care of Mrs. Snow when I went abroad—I am not aware that there were any other letters besides those two parcels, which I have referred to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why were some of those letters destroyed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I destroyed them as soon as I read them—there were no letters in the hands of any other person in the house, that I am aware of—I have written to Mrs. Dixon, the housekeeper—I am not aware that Mrs. Dixon had any letters of mine—I did not correspond with Mrs. Dixon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you write from the Continent to Mrs. Dixon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Snow wrote once, and I wrote from Paris once, to tell her that Mr. Snow was coming home—I never corresponded with Mrs. Dixon on any other occasion—Mr. Snow wrote, I believe—I never did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you been in Paris before this visit that you took with Mr. Snow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, several years ago—I was not there by myself, I was with my father—I was there about two months, about seven years ago—I did not go into society at all, and made no Parisian acquaintances—on the last occasion I was in Paris about three weeks, I think, or not quite so much—I have only been in Paris twice since I married—I was not educated in Paris—I have been a good deal abroad—when I was in Paris last I did not keep much</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201310163"></xptr>
               <p>company—I went to visit some friends of my father's in the country, some distance from Paris, near Versailles—Mr. Snow did not accompany me—he was in England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long did you remain in Paris after Mr. Snow quitted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not quite a fortnight—I resided during that fortnight at an hotel in the Area di Rivoli—I did not reside there all the six weeks—I had previously resided at the hotel Maurice, but Mr. Snow wished roe to move to the other hotel—he took apartments there for me before he left Paris—I never saw the pri<lb></lb>soner till the day I appeared before the Magistrate—that is correct—I never saw him in Paris, nor in any part of England—I never met him at Dulwich—I spent eight or nine years on the Continent before I married—I have never, by letter or otherwise, received any presents from the pri<lb></lb>soner, not within the last twelve months, or two years—I never received a ring with a ruby—there are some proceedings going on at this time be<lb></lb>tween Mr. Snow and myself in the Ecclesiastical Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe those proceedings have been instituted by yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I am the complaining party—my former visit to Paris was about the period when I lost one of my children—that is seven years ago—I was accompanied from Paris, on the last occasion, by my eldest brother, not the one who is head-master of St. Paul's school—I was very unwell while I was staying at my brother's house at St. Paul's, which was when I first arrived, on the 8th of December—I went straight to my brother's house, and remained there till the 51st of December—I was very ill indeed from the 13th—I was taken ill on the 13th, and remained very ill until I left on the 31st—I never stirred out of the house—when I left on the 31st, I went to my father's in Arlington-street—on the 5th of Ja<lb></lb>nuary, I went to Mr. Whittaker's, a friend' of my father's, in Surrey, and remained there till the 17th of January—I did not come to London in the mean time—on the 17th of January I went to my father's again, and have remained there from that time to the present—I am there now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Little Pulteney-street, in the parish of St. James's, Westminster. I occupy the whole house—I went to bed on Saturday, the 18th of April, between twelve and one o'clock at night—the doors and windows were all secured—I have a back door to the house, which was only shut too—it has no lock, but a bolt—it was not bolted—any body in the yard could open it—there was a bolt on it, and when I left it I bolted it, but lodgers might have come down after<lb></lb>wards, and unbolted it—it was bolted when I went to bed—it is occasion<lb></lb>ally opened after I go to bed—I was not alarmed—I was called up by my servant at seven o'clock in the morning as usual, and found the parlour-door burst open, that had been locked own night—I had taken the key up with me—I found all the drawers and boxes in the room opened, and a great many articles of apparel gone—I went into the shop—that door was not locked over night, but it was closed—I missed from a desk a ring, and the copper money mentioned—I went down to the station-house, and there found a cash-box, which I had not missed before, as I went down directly—I found a coat at the watchhouse—I missed some shirts, handkerchiefs, neck handkerchiefs, two umbrellas, and some stockings, worth altogether about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not replace them—I had taken a very remarkable halfpenny on the Saturday night, and left it locked up in the desk—I have since seen that in the hands of the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 145.) I was on duty in Peter-street, on Sunday morning, the 19th of April, at four o'clock—I saw the prisoner come out of Walker's-court, St. James's, with a coat under his arm—that was two or three hundred yards from the prosecutor's house—it was just getting light—I could see the features of a man, at that time, by the light of day—he crossed Peter-street, and entered the door of No. 7, which is a lodging-house—I waited there till my brother officer came up, and went in, and found the prisoner concealed behind the door of a room—he was standing behind it, pretending to be asleep—my brother officer took the coat up, which was lying down on the floor, and the cash-box was wrapped up in it—we took him to the station-house on suspicion.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 154.) I went into the house, No. 7, Peter-street. The oven-door was fastened—I put my hand through the window, unbolted it, and behind the door the prisoner stood, pretending to be asleep—I asked what he did there—he made no reply—I asked where the coat was which he had under his arm—he said he had no coat—I found it there, and the cash-box in it—I took him to the station-house, and</p>

               <p>found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper, and three farthings on him—the sergeant on duty was with me—I afterwards returned to No. 7, Peter-street, and examined a stone in the yard, under a step-ladder—I found two centre-bits, one stock, eight skeleton-keys, two latch-keys, and one screw-driver—the yard be<lb></lb>longs to No. 7, it is open to the street, as the door stands open all night long—the stone was close to the door—they were under a loose stone.</p>

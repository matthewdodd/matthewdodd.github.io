            . I am a Custom House officer. I was in the George, public-house, between four and five o'clock that afternoon, the prisoner and prosecutor were drinking together, in company with a woman. I did not think the prosecutor was very drunk. I suspected the prisoner, having heard the prosecutor had been receiving money. I advised the prosecutor to give his money to the landlord until the morning. The prisoner called me a b-dy Jacob, and asked if I thought he was going to be taken-in by a flat of my kind-that he had been too long in town. On my asking him to give the money to the landlord, he snapped his fingers, and said he would see me d-d first. I did not know he had got the prosecutor's money - I only took the sailor's word for it. I told the prisoner if he did not give up the money I would send for an officer, which I did; as soon as the officer came I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170020"></xptr>told him the prisoner had got the prosecutor's money - He denied having more than 1l. about him, and said he had none of the prosecutor's money. The officer searched him - He attempted to strike him. I laid hold of one of his arms. The officer found a 5l. and three 1l. notes, in his pocket. He then said we were all a set of thieves together. I had advised him before the officer, to give the the money up to the man; he said he had it, and would keep it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and found the prosecutor and prisoner together, with a woman-the prosecutor was drunk. Kelly said the prosecutor had been robbed. I asked him if he had been robbed? he said, Yes. Kelly pointed out the prisoner as the man. I desired him to give the man his money; he said he had not got it, and had not robbed the prosecutor. I told him not to be obstinate, but return the money, and keep himself out of trouble; he insisted that he had not got the money. I then attempted to search him - He tried to strike me in the face, I stopped the blow, collared him, searched him, and found a 5l. and three 1l. notes upon him. He then said he only meant to take care of them - He had denied having them several times.</p>

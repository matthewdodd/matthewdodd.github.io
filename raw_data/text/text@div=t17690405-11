We took them to his lodging in Jacob's Court, Cow-Cross. Two of them were disposed of to Mrs. Lamb, and the other were disposed of without my knowledge.

               <p>Ackerley. I am a perukemaker. This was the effect of intoxication with liquor. We were drinking together, and he proposed it to me.</p>

               <p>Ackerley. He worked in the crane at the keys.</p>

            . There were twenty baskets with raisins weighed the day before; they were put under the window where the bars were found cut. The next day I counted them, and there were no more than fifteen of them. Among the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050009"></xptr> twenty I had observed one of the baskets to be of a different kind, and this is that very basket. I mentioned that at seeing it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Cripplegate. On Thursday, the 12th of April, I went there in consequence of information, at a quarter-past eight o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Woolf's premises, <placeName id="t18270531-327-crimeloc1762">No.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310123"></xptr>11, Aldermanbury</placeName>

I have reason to believe he threw it at me, but it did not hit me - I followed, till he got to Moor-lane, in the parish of Cripplegate without, and then I secured him, with the assistance of others - I suppose he had run near a quarter of a mile - I brought him back to the watch-house, in Aldermanbury - I found on him eight skeleton keys, a little jemmy, a knife, and a piece of string; the other officer, who was with me, picked up a crow-bar in the street - I accused him of coming from Mr. Woolf's; he said he had not, I was mistaken; we placed him in the Computer - I and the officer came back and opened Mr. Woolf's door, with one of the skeleton keys which we found on him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he carry anything with him out of Mr. Woolf's? A. No; when we opened the door there were nine ends of cloth, tied together, ready to be thrown into a cart - on the right-hand of the warehouse is a door which goes into a passage that appeared to have been attempted to be broken open - the wood-work of the partition was broken away. I went on further, and found another door, which was open, and the patent padlock broken off; on the counter there were eight more ends of cloth tied together the same way as the others and with the same sort of string - there was a piece of striped cotton and a piece of sheeting; this is some of the string I found on the prisoner - it is the same as that the cloth was tied with - it does not belong to the prosecutor. I found a great quantity of string on the prisoner; the property removed was of great extent - some was in the passage and some on a shop-board in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there a great many persons passing? A. Yes; it was not possible that any other person could have come out, and I mistake the prisoner for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long have you been an officer? A. About fifteen months. I found this key opened the door. I saw the other officer open the door. I saw him come out; there were several people in the street - the lamps were alight; he walked out of the house and shut the door - there were no persons between him and me - when he walked away there were three or four persons at one corner and another. I did not lose sight of him, as the street he went down was opposite - there are several turnings between the prosecutor's house and Moor-lane; but I did not lose sight of him - there were two other officers following him. I did not pick up the crow-bar - it was brought to the watch-house. I was not more than two or three yards from him, while he was running. I struck him once or twice, but could not lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he run immediately he left the house. A. No; he walked across the road. I could not take him- he was about three yards from me; I could not reach him. I began to run and so did he.</p>

            . I have been an officer for fifteen years. I was with Henman and another officer. We went there by design. I saw the prisoner come out of No.11; he walked across the street, into Philip-lane; Henman stepped pretty quick after him - I followed, and Neal came after me- when we came to the end of Philip-lane I heard a piece of iron fall; a young man took it up; I took it from him, Henman ran down London-wall, up Aldermanbury-postern, across Fore-street, and up Moor-lane; I lost sight of him, but when I got into Moor-lane Henman had got him; we took him to the watch-house, and found these skeleton-keys on him - I am sure he is the same person. I went back to the premises, and found them in the state that has been described; I opened the door myself, with this key; the string round the parcels corresponds with this found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are there not thousands of pieces of string like this? A. I suppose there may be; there were no persons by the side of the door, but there were others at the top of the street, and some at the bottom; I suppose there was no person nearer than fifteen or sixteen yards from the door when the prisoner came out - Henman was about three yards from him. I heard him shut the door - he took time to do that; the door was shut I know before he came out; I believe Henman was not certain whether he belonged to the house or not - that is what I understood; we have not particularly talked this business over - we have spoken of it, but I never think much of it after a prisoner is taken up, till he is tried. I lost sight if Henman while I stopped to get the crow-bar; I suppose he was then two or three yards from the prisoner; it is a straight line into Phillip-lane - there is no turning there; I lost sight of the prisoner directly almost; I only saw Henman and him in Philip-lane; he was not more than three or four yards from him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Corners, or no corners, do you state, upon your oath, that is the man who came out of the house? A. Yes, I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was there any other person came out of the house? A. No. A cart came about eight o'clock, and stood by the door-way.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with the other officers, and saw the prisoner come out of the house - he shut the door after him; what they have stated is correct; these tools were found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What distance were you from the house? A. About five yards; the lamps were alight; there was a lamp just over the house - he crossed the road, into Philip-lane; I was in the middle of the road when he came out; I did not see him taken - I can swear to him, from seeing his face, and seeing him come out of the house; I could not seize him - he was about five yards from me; I did not run at him.</p>

On Thursday, the 12th of April, I left the warehouse at about half-past four o'clock. or a quarter before five, perfectly locked up and secured; I went out at the side door - there was a door leading from the passage to the warehouse - it fastens inside; there is a bar, two bolts, and a double lock in the middle warehouse; there is another door, with a bar and a padlock, which is here. When I went out I fastened the street door with a double lock - I had left all the woollen cloth safe in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310124"></xptr>warehouse, as usual, not tied up with string, nor in the passage, but in the cases, and the lined cloth also. I heard of the robbery afterwards, and went to the warehouse; I overtook Mr. Woolf and the officers - when I got there I found the property tied up in bundles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you leave any one in the warehouse? A. No. It was Mr. Woolf's dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>MOZELY WOOLF. I am a warehouseman - my warehouse is at No. 11, Addle-street, Aldermanbury - I am sure I do not know whether it is in the parish of St. Mary-the-Virgin or no; it is my dwelling-house; my servant sleeps there at night, to guard the property; he sleeps there as my servant; he leaves at five o'clock to go to dinner; he calls at my house in Goodman's-fields, and returns at nine o'clock to sleep there.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JAMES WEBB. Q. Did you sleep there that night? A. Yes, with the officer; I slept there the night before; I am always in the habit of sleeping there; I have slept there about eleven weeks altogether; I have slept away, and had slept there about a month before the removal of these goods, but will not swear I slept there constantly; I can swear I did not sleep out of it for four nights in that month; I do not dine or drink tea in the house, but I sleep there to take care of the things.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. WOOLF. Q. At What hour was your attention drawn to this warehouse? A. The officer came, and told me of it about ten o'clock, and I went there; I lound my clothes tied up by threes, and a number of things removed; one piece of sheeting was very much cut with some instrument; there were three hundred or four hundred yards of cloth and kerseymere removed, to the amount of 170l.; my servant slept there by my orders since Mr. Fanchard left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did he sleep there to take care of your property? A. Yes, that was my object; he was my porter then; he does other things, such as clean boots and shoes, and knives; he slept in the warehouse to take care of the property; I live at No. 26, Mansell-street, Goodman's-fields, not at the warehouse; I do not intend to remove there; I have lived in Mansell-street ten years; it is at Mansell-street he acts as my domestic servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have sent him there to take care of your goods, and watch the house at night? A. I do not sleep at the warehouse; Goodman's-fields is where I eat my meals; I have taken a lunch, and have dined at Addle-street; if I were asked where I reside, I should say, from such a time to such a time, I should be at Addle-street, and other times at Goodman's-fields; my servant sleeps there, and does other things.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have occasionally eat your meals there? A. Yes; and this man is to do any thing there which I bid him; I have no bed there myself.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you pay assessed taxes for it as your dwelling-house? A. Yes.</p>

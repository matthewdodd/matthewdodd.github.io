                  </hi>. I have been in the 80th regiment of foot eight years—I left the regiment in New South Wales, but was discharged at Chatham—on the 10th of August I was in London, and fell in with the prisoner, about six o'clock in the afternoon, in Covent Garden—she was walking up the street—I was never in London before, and I asked her if she could tell me where I could get decent lodgings—she said she could get me lodgings—I told her if it was a decent house I would be obliged to her to show me, and I would pay her for her trouble—I treated her with a pot of beer, and gave her a small portion of gin—we then went to a house—we had a few words, and I gave her a crown for herself, and two shillings I paid for the room—we went up stairs, and went to bed—I folded up my trowsers, and placed them under the bolster—I had three sovereigns, five shillings, and three sixpences, which I had placed in my fob-pocket—I went to bed about a quarter before eight o'clock—I Was a little fatigued with travelling—I was just feeling drowsy, when I felt something raise my head—I might have been in bed three-quarters of an hour—I got up and felt, and my trowsers were not where I had placed them I found them on the floor—I felt in the fob, and the money was gone—I accused her of taking it—she was in the room, on the floor, not in bed—I had a few words with her, and she said she had not seen any money of mine—I called out for a policeman to be brought in—the police-man came, and I gave her in charge—there was one sovereign and two sixpences found, and one penny.</p>

About nine o'clock, on the 10th of August, I was called to No. 3, Legg-alley, to take in charge the prisoner for robbing the prosecutor—I went up stairs, and found them both undressed—the prisoner found a sovereign, and gave it to me—I found a sixpence and a penny in the room—the prosecutor had had a little drink, but was not tipsy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I met this man in Seven Dials, very drunk, with another soldier—he had a bundle, I said, "You will lose the bundle if you don't take care"—it dropped, and I took it up—he said, "You take care of it, I will reward you for it"—he went into one public-house—they would not serve him, he was so tipsy—he went into another, and had a Pot of beer, and a glass of gin for me—he then went to another, and had mother pot of beer, and a quartern of gin—he pulled out a sovereign and some silver, and the other man said, "Take care of your little money, and get yourself a comrade"—he then said, "Come, I will show you where I "lodge"—they went out for about ten minutes, leaving me and another woman, and the bundle—the prosecutor came back—he asked me to get him a lodging—I took him up Long Acre—he went to a house, and paid two shillings for a bed—I went up stairs and took the bundle, and when we went</p>

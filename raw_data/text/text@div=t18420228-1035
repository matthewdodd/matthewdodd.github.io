                  </hi>. I have one partner—we live at Nos. 2 and 3, Monmouth-court, Seven Dials, and are printers and publishers. Frederick Roff was in our employ about twenty-two months—he was employed in cut<lb></lb>ting, sewing, and making up different works—we used to deliver him the pa<lb></lb>per alter it was printed to take home and finish them—on the 12th of February I received information, and accompanied Williams to Roff's house in Mount-street, Bethnal-green—I had before that day delivered him sheets of this description of paper to the value of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a great deal more of this and others—it was his duty to have it stitched and returned to me—the greater part of it wag not returned—some of them were religious works, and some other works—I charged him with having robbed me of different works—he said at first he had not, and then he said he had had two or three girls, who had robbed him, and he wanted to accuse his sister of robbing him—I then beckoned Williams, who was at the door, and gave him into custody—I then went round to several shops with Williams—when Frederick Roff was taken his wife was present—she said she had often cautioned him of it, and said, "See what your skittle play has brought your child and me to"—she had a little baby with her two or three months old—we went to John Spratt's, and found some property there—we went to Cauch's and Crew's, and other places, and found some more—these ought all to have been made into books, and returned to me, not sold for waste paper.</p>

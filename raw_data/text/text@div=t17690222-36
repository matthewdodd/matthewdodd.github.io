The prisoner came to my house and asked for a gown that lay for 30 s. but we could not find it. I begged of her to let it alone, and I would make a search for it. I left her alone in the shop, and went to my back room, and came back in about ten minutes; then the Prisoner was gone. I missed a box with four guineas and a four-and-sixpenny-piece in it; I sent my man to some pawnbrokers, desiring, if she came to fetch any thing out, to stop her. He brought me word, that one in Diet-street knew her well, and, if she came there, he would stop her: after that he sent me word she was there. I went and found her there, and charged her with taking the money; she said, she had none of my money: she was searched, and had four guineas found upon her. I and he asked her how she came by it: after some time she owned it was part of my money, and that she took it from my desk. I went to her lodgings to inquire if I could find my box, and I was told she had sent a bit of bad money out to get it changed and it was returned. I found it in the hands of her landlady; I know it to be mine; it is not a good one.</p>

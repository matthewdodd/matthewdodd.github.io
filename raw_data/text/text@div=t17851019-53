               <p>Last Tuesday evening, I saw the two prisoners, I saw Rankin with a cask of butter on his shoulder, in Newgate-street, going from Cheapside; Rankin had the butter, I turned round and followed them; Rankin pitched it down by the Horse-shoe passage, Roberts helped him down with it, Rankin sat upon it, and wrapped his coat round it, the other went away towards Cheapside; I went over to Mr. Clement's, and Mr. Holmes came with me, I asked Rankin to get up that I might look at the marks, Rankin said he did not know what it was, he was left in charge; and as I was standing, Rankin struck me over the the head, and ran off, I called out stop thief! Mr. Holmes ran after him, and he was stopped and brought back, I am sure he is the same man, the other was gone; a coach came to the Horse-shoe passage to take up the butter, and the coachman asked what he was to take up, Roberts afterwards d - d his eyes, and said if ever he got clear of this, he would do for me.</p>
               <p>- HOLMES sworn.</p>
               <p>I found the prisoner Rankin at the end of the Horse-shoe-passage, waiting while Roberts was gone for a coach; and I followed him and saw him stopped in St. Paul's Church-yard, I am positive to the man.</p>
               <p>What became of the butter? - It was left in Newgate-street till the next day, he never was quite out out of my sight, he was then taken to Guildhall; I observed the marks.</p>

               <p>How long did he come in before the prisoner? - The prisoner came in a good while before West.</p>
               <p>When did West come in? - About six o'clock I believe it might be; I cannot rightly say, I believe it to be between five and six.</p>
               <p>Did anybody come in with him? - No.</p>
               <p>How many women were there in company? - I do not recollect ever a one.</p>
               <p>What, not the whole evening? - No, they might come in backwards and forwards, but never to set down.</p>
               <p>What had you for supper? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Had anybody anything? - Not that I saw, nobody had anything to eat while I was there.</p>
               <p>Who went away first? - We all came away together; I was acquainted with West before, he came there about some shoes.</p>
               <p>How long was the prisoner out during that time? - I never knew him out, not at all, only to make water, and in again.</p>
               <p>You were there a considerable time before the prisoner? - Yes, I was there at ten in the morning, I was not out till I came out for good at eleven, I came in between four and five, and the prisoner between five and six.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true that you went with West to help him to carry the shoes home? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not come in with West? - No.</p>
               <p>That is not true? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you drink, beer or spirits? - Beer, and several three penny worths of gin and water.</p>

               <p>Court. In the first place let these two witnesses West and Marsh be committed to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoners. You have both of you been convicted upon very satisfactory evidence which has perfectly convinced my mind, as well as that of the Jury, of your guilt; and from the circumstances of this case, you appear to be extremely improper and dangerous men to be suffered to go at large in this country, to have an opportunity of plundering your innocent fellow citizens; it is therefore necessary for justice, and the public safety, that I should send both of you out of the country; but I think it necessary to make a distinction in your cases now, though there was none before, for I consider the guilt of Roberts as greatly aggravated by the perjured defence he has set up in a Court of justice; I have always kept a very strict watch over perjured defences set up by witnesses, and I have thought it my duty to put these witnesses into a mode of receiving the punishment they have deserved; but I have also thought it right in all cases to increase as much as the law will permit me, the punishment of those offenders who have dared to set up such a perjured defence; for the mischief of the perjury does not merely stop in the perversion of justice in that single trial in which it is produced, but it has a tendency to deprive innocent men of the benefit of that sort of testimony, and to render it suspected even if true; these sort of defences have been so frequent, that the moment they are mentioned they are looked upon with a jealous eye, both by the Court and Jury, and the consequence of which may sometimes be to pervert the truth on the other side, and to render it not worthy of that attention it might deserve. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190092"></xptr> sentence of the Court therefore is, <rs id="t17851019-53-punish265" type="punishmentDescription">

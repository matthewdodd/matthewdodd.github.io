               <p>I rely on your mercy: I look on it I am in the hands of very wicked people. It was a very wet night, I went into Mr. Woodley's about ten o'clock, and stopped half an hour; the prisoner was much in liquor, he asked me to drink, and where I lived; I told him he might go up stairs, an acquaintance lived there, the bed was down and made; he said, God bless me, I could not have thought so good a bed had been in this distressed place; says he, what shall I give you to lay with you all night; I says, Sir, you could not go to offer any body less than a crown; he said, I think half-a-crown is enough; I said make me a present of that; he said, undress yourself first; I said no, but there is no harm done, go down stairs again. There was a shelf behind the door, there were a dozen and an half of Queen's ware plates, two large dishes, and a bowl; he staggered against the door, and threw down the shelf, and broke the things; a little girl in the next room told Brady and Denton they were broke: he refused to pay for them. He took up a poker and hit me, and he went to hit at the cupboard with the poker, we pulled the poker backwards, and he fell down.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Rose called four witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Woodley called three witnesses who gave him a good character; and one of them said he saw him lend some money on a watch, but could not tell what watch.</p>
               <p>To Price. Did you see what was thrown down? - I heard them fall, and I turned round, they were a yard and an half from me; they were behind me, I never saw them till they fell, it seemed to be a board a yard long, and they seemed to be broke before, they seemed like white plates; there might be eight or nine.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you sober? - Yes.</p>

            .) What Goods did you at any Time lose?</p>
               <p>Mead. I missed the Things mention'd in the Indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them? Was this Woman conversant at all in the House where the Goods were?</p>
               <p>Mead. No, my Lord, she lived a <rs id="t17460117-6-deflabel20" type="occupation">Servant</rs>

               <p>Q. What reason have you to suspect the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Mead. We serv'd the Gentlewoman next Door with Beer; we <rs id="t17460117-6-viclabel21" type="occupation">keep a Publick House</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17460117-6-victim114 t17460117-6-viclabel21"></join>. Some odd Things were left behind by the Prisoner's Mistress, who was then moved to another House; and while we were at Dinner, the Prisoner brought in a Steak, which we dress'd for her; she drank a Pennyworth of Beer, and then took her Leave of us. Soon after missing the Box with the Linnen and Apparel, we had a Suspicion of the Prisoner. I found out her Mistress's House, and knocking at the Door, the Prisoner came out; I challeng'd her with the Box; she said, she knew nothing of it. I asked her Mistress; she said, she hoped she had not been guilty of such a Thing; upon searching, we found the Box broke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174601170007"></xptr> open in the Cellar, with the Things in it as they are now.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the Box, what did you do?</p>
               <p>Mead. Why, I took it to the Publick House, where I had got the Maid to come before, and her Mistress went with me.</p>

            (to Mrs. Mead.) When did you miss your Box?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mead. My Box was in the Room at Three o'Clock, I open'd it and lock'd it again. This Woman (the Prisoner) was the only Person in the House, tho' I did not see her take it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you miss your Box?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mead. I saw it about Three, and missed it about Five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Prisoner at her Mistress's, after the Box was found?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mead. I did not, my Lord, but my Husband did. <rs id="t17460117-6-verdict22" type="verdictDescription">

They went out for about eight or ten minutes, and came again; and told me they wanted to look at some more to make a shift. Master came forward and gave me orders to watch them, I did; and thought Deverix had something under her left arm, she had a cloak on, I saw it was coloured by a little bit that hung down, I thought it was check. They both went out without buying then. I told master they had something; he bid me go after them, I went to a shoemaker's shop, and took

The other immediately ran up the passage, Brown ran after her and took hold on her, we brought them back; we met a person about the Hospital-gate, that swore at us, and bid us let them go about their business; when we came into the shop, Brown took the Handkerchiefs out of More's pocket, [produced in court,] a piece of soosea for handkerchiefs, the property of my master, which had been shewed to a customer about half an hour before; one was sold, there were twelve handkerchiefs in the piece.</p>

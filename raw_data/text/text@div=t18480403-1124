                  </hi> I am the wife of Henry Wilson, who keeps the Collett Arms, White Horse-street, Limehouse. On 22nd, March, between twelve and one o'clock, I had a gold watch on the mantel-piece, in my bed<lb></lb>room, on the first floor—between three and four, Mr. Jackson, a customer, who I had known some time, and the prisoner, came into the house, and went up stairs into the long-room, which is on the left of my bedroom—after they were gone, about six o'clock, I went up and missed the watch—it was in a case, and had a key attached to it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is worth twenty guineas—I should think this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the key—it is very similar, and winds the watch up.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Clark-street, Stepney. On 22nd March I accom<lb></lb>panied the prisoner to the Collett Arms—I asked if he had seen the long<lb></lb>room up stairs—he said he should like to see it, he had heard it spoken of—with Mrs. Wilson's permission we went up, I in advance—I had been up there about a minute, looking at some picture of friends of mine, which huge there—I thought he was behind me, but on turning round I missed him—I called out, "Nicks, where are you?"—he said, "Here I am, I am coming"—his voice appeared to come from close at hand, in a direction of the bedroom door—he had not then been in the long-room—I went out to the landing, and the bedroom door being partly open, I saw him walk round at the foot of the bed, and he met me in the passage—he came from the room—I said, "Nicks, it is very odd of you; what business had you in that room?" or words to that effect—he said, "I only went to look at it"—I said, "You had no business there, I only brought you to look at this room"—we went into the room, which is a club-room, looked round it, came down again, and we parted.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Several years—he was a publican on Clerkenwell-green—the last house I knew him in was the Cricketers, at Ratcliffe-cross—after that he was in a beer-shop, in Union-street, Bishopsgate—I have nothing to say against his character—I know his mother very well; she is a retired victualler, and a woman of con<lb></lb>siderable property, I believe—I have seen the prisoner drunk occasionally—he had not been drinking to excess this day that I am aware of—I had been with him from eleven o'clock—he had been drinking—I think he had some gin and water, and afterwards some brandy and water—we had half-and-half at the Collett Arms—during the five years I have known him I know nothing detrimental to his character.</p>

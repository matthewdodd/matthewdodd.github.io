I received this bill from a customer named Dowell—the prisoner was in my service—I placed this bill in an iron safe on the 18th of April, till I had more, to go to my banker's—the prisoner had access to that safe—I missed it on the 2nd of May—I asked him where it was—he said he did not know—I am sure of that—I told him I missed it—I made inquiries in town of a person who I suspected the pri<lb></lb>soner had taken it to—my inquiries were unsuccessful—I was making in<lb></lb>quiries</p>

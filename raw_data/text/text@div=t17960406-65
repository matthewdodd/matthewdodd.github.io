            Was that information before or after the dissolution of the partnership? - A. A few days after; I went with an officer, Mr. Sapwell, and took up the porter; he was searched, but nothing of any property of mine was found upon him; he was taken to the Compter, and the next day examined by the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At the dissolution of the partnership what became of the property, did it become your's? - A. Yes.</p>

            Did you go any where before you went to the Lord-Mayor to make any search? - A. I don't recollect that I did; Sapwell, the constable, went with me afterwards to the prisoner's lodgings, Sparrow-corner, Tower-hill; we searched his lodgings and found two small pieces of linen cloth, upon one of which was my private mark, it was found in a room that had the appearance of a kitchen, in a drawer; I am quite certain it was my property; we did not find any thing else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. You dissolved the partnership on the 20th of February? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you settle the matter? - A. I paid him his proportion of the profits, and took upon me the property, and all the debts; the agreement left the whole of the property with me; I was to pay for it as soon as the attorney had drawn out the deed, that was in about ten days, or a fortnight; I believe, not a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. That was after the prisoner was in custody? - A. It was.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. That piece of duck, with the private mark, Mr. Brounger gave me, a fortnight before Christmas, to line a jacket; he was writing in the counting-house; I went and asked him for it; he told me to go up stairs, and ask above; I went up and asked Grose, he said, he had got none there, there were remnants enough below; I came down and took these two pieces, about enough to mend my jacket, and make pockets, and shewed them to Mr. Brounger, and he said it was very well.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Brounger). Q. Did you ever give him that piece of duck? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the prisoner). Q. Did you speak of that found in your lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character).</p>

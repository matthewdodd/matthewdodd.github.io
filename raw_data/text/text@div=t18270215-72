               <p>BENJAMIN BRANSGROVE. On the 1st of this month I left two waistcoats and a pair of trousers in my room, at <placeName id="t18270215-72-crimeloc396">No. 2, Market-street, Bloomsbury-square</placeName>

On the Tuesday in the next week I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings, and part, if not all the property, was found under the bed - a bundle of duplicates dropped out, part of which related to my property; one of the waistcoats had been made for sale - the other was bespoken; the prisoner worked by the piece - these garments are the same that were taken away - he had worked for me two months.</p>

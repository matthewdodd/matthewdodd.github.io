On the 14th of November, about five o'clock in the afternoon, as I came home, I found my shop window in a disordered state, and when I got in, I found a piece was cut out of the bottom square, about five inches by three - it was whole at a quarter to four o'clock; I missed three wooden boxes, which cost me 1s. 3d. each, three at 10d. each, also six segar-tubes, which cost me 12s. 6d. - I found the snuff-boxes at the office, with a purse which I had not missed - I rent the house.</p>

            . I am a patrol, and live in Titchbourn-court, Holborn. On the 14th of November, at a quarter past five o'clock, I met the prisoner in Crown-street, Soho, with two boys less than himself - they were all standing together, but when we got towards them they walked on - I secured the prisoner, and Cuthbert, who was with me, took the others; I felt these boxes in his breeches - he said they were his own, and, as I was taking them out, I asked where he got them - he said he picked them up, wrapped in a piece of green paper, at Charing-cross, and he could not tell how many there were; I found there were six boxes and a purse - I asked if he had picked the purse up - he said there was none - we took them all to the office, where the prosecutor described one of the boxes before he saw it.</p>

I believe all these boxes to be mine, by the patterns, but I know one in particular by the plug being out - I have not found the segar-holders - some of the boxes were eighteen inches above the broken pann - they could not have fallen out of the window; I had gone out at eight o'clock in the morning - my wife, whose name is Mary Ann Catherine, and the servant, were at home when I returned.</p>

            . I live opposite Mr. Botts. I was looking out at my window on the 12th of May, and saw the prisoner and two others go to the prosecutor's window - the prisoner took the two brushes, and gave them to another man, who ran away with them; I went over, and told the apprentice - we ran, and took the prisoner, who was walking on as if nothing was the matter; I told him what he had done - he did not deny it, but said to the apprentice "You know where I live, and can find me at any time - I will go and fetch them back;" I said, "Don't you mean to give him in charge?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I don't know what to do," and he let him go, but the prisoner did not come back, as I understand - I went home; the apprentice and two or three more came to my house about ten o'clock, with the prisoner; I said that was him - the prisoner said he knew nothing of it; he then began to beg and pray that they would let him go, and said he would take us to where the brushes were; we went along - he said, "One of them is in pawn, and I have not enough by 6d. to get it out:" we went to the pawnbroker's, and while there the prisoner ran away.</p>

I was walking up the street with two boys - one of them cut the brushes, and the other took them; this gentleman and another came and said I took them - I said No: the apprentice then said Cheney had them; I said if he had I could easily get them - at ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270029"></xptr>ten o'clock I met the apprentice again, and he took me to the witness.</p>

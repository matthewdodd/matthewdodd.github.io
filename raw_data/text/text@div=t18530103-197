On Friday, 17th Dec., about half-past 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came there; there were very few other persons in the shop; most of them were at their tea—the prisoner spoke to me in an obsequious manner, as if he knew me—I had never seen him before—he asked me how I was first, and then produced two patterns of cloth, and ordered two yards of each of them—he purchased five yards of</p>

Johnson, 37, Great Queen-street," but I did not take any notice of what was on the back—I saw that the back was written on, and here is a name above it—I handed it to our cashier, Wipple—I did not notice whether the ink was dry—the cashier gave me some change, I gave the prisoner the difference of the note, and he went away, after saying he should return shortly to purchase some farther articles—I afterwards went to Newgate, by the direction of the detective officer, to see a man who was in custody for a similar offence, it was not the prisoner, but Badoski (<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 236)—I afterwards went to the Mansion-house, I think it was on a Tuesday; and after I had been there some time, I observed the prisoner enter; I followed him at a small distance, and stood by him some time alone, to assure myself that it was the same man; and being perfectly satisfied, I procured the assistance of a detective officer, and we together stood by him, and watched him for an hour or upwards—I observed him noticing me; he was casting his eyes in a sidelong direction at myself and the officer, without directly gazing at us, and he was leaving the Court when I gave him into custody.</p>

I was at the Mansion House in the course of my duty, and saw Cockrell in the body of the Court—a foreigner, named Badoski, was to be examined for uttering forged notes, that day—I saw the prisoner in Court; he was at the further end of the Court when I first saw him—Mr. Cockrell called my attention to him—he was in my view a little better than an hour, I should think—I and Cockrell were standing together some part of the time, and the prisoner looked at us several times and got shifting towards the door (I was in plain clothes)—he kept shifting along a little, and at the end of one case which was being heard, there was a little bit of a <hi rend="italic">bustle</hi> in the Court, and he made a rush towards the door—I went up to him, caught hold of his arm, and said; "I want you"—he said, "Which station are you going to take me to?"—I told him I was going to take him to Bow-street police station—we got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> by the Mansion-house; when we got part of the way up Cheapside, I asked him if he knew what he was charged with; he said, "No"—I then told him he was charged with uttering a forged 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note at Bull and Wilson's, in St. Martin's-lane; he said, "Oh! I know Bull and Wilson's very well; I have had dealings with them"—we then went there for the young gentleman to come and press the charge against him—I searched him at the station, and found a petition to the Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police in his pocket, and asked him what it was; he said it was a petition to the Commissioners of Police, as he was desirous of getting into the police force, and the reason he was at the Mansion House was to see how business was conducted—he afterwards said he went there to get some gentlemen to sign the petition—I found several papers upon him, and among others this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in which I find the name of Johnson written in two places.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at No. 3, Cardigan-street, Kennington. The prisoner is my godson and nephew—he lodged in my house—I remember hearing of this accusation against him—I know where he was at the latter part of the afternoon of 17th Dec.—I saw him a little before 4 o'clock at my house—I did not have tea with him; he came too late for tea. we had tea early—he remained there the whole of the evening—when he came in I was cutting an ox head to pieces that I had bought; it was not a prize ox, it was one that came from the cattle show—he said, "My God! Uncle, what are you going to do with all that?"—I said, "Some of it I am going to salt, and some I am going to stew, to make soup of"—he then went to writing at the end of a chest of drawers in my room until it was dusk, and he could not see to write any more—I had done what I was going to do with the meat, and we sat down and played at cards together the whole of the evening—we played at cribbage—he and I had supper by our two selves—the female part of the family were gone to bed; by the female part of the family I mean my wife and my wife's sister—they are here—he and I had some of the head stewed for our supper—I attended before the Magistrate—the prisoner never left my house that evening.</p>

               <p>and he went to his books, as he usually does, till it was dusk—I should think he wrote for about three quarters of an hour, and then we sat down to cards—I have not got a clock that will go—he went out once to fetch a little porter from a public house about 100 yards away; that might be about 10 o'clock in the evening—this is my handwriting to this deposition—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"This deponent Joseph Levitt on his oath saith as follows: 'I live at No. 3, Cardigan-street, Kennington—I am a carpenter—the prisoner is my nephew—on the Monday I believe that this note was offered to be passed he was at home by dusk, I will say 5 o'clock, and he had tea with me when I came home from work—I cannot speak as to any other day that week—the prisoner's name is William Marks, I was his godfather, and he was named William; he has gone by that name ever since'")—I have never been in custody in my life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness.

               <p>Q. Did you pursue after him - A. I did; I saw the prisoner's face remarkably plain, by the light of the pastry cooks shop; he walked away, and I walked after him; the prisoner turned up the market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him - A. I did, for a quarter of an hour; afterwards I saw the prisoner with two other persons walking up Leadenhall-street again; I told the watchman of that; he followed them down Gracechurch-street; the watchman apprehended the prisoner, and the other two set off directly. The prisoner was searched; neither the seal nor the key were found on him. I am quite sure of this man, who laid hold of my watch seal, and key.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the seal worth - A. I gave eighteen shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said, it was two or three quarters of an hour after you lost sight of him, before you saw him again - A. No.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my box is the corner of Leadenhall-market. I saw a young man there, who told me he had been robbed; three men were coming up the street arm in arm together; I said, are you sure which is your man, that when they come up, I may lay hold of the right. He picked out this man from the three; I took hold of him, and the other two walked away. I took the prisoner the other way to what the other men were going; they were off in an instant; I cannot positively say whether they walked or run. I searched the prisoner; I found nothing on him.</p>

I have known the prisoner two years or more; on the 30th of March she was an out-door pauper - she came to the store-room that day with this order, in consequence of which I gave her a shift, petticoat, and a pair of shoes - I believed it to be a genuine order.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TUCKER. I am an assistant-overseer. This order is not my writing, nor that of any person authorized by me; no one but myself ever issues an order in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120106"></xptr>name - upon my solemn oath, I never gave the prisoner this order, and I knew nothing of it till the matron showed it to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got the order from Mr. Tucker - I was in Islington farm-house, and lent a girl my things; she never returned - I had to go on the 28th of March, and ask for clothes from Mr. Tucker; he would not give me any - he said he was not going to lend clothes to clothe other paupers; I went to him again on the 29th, and he would not - I went again on the 30th, and he gave me this order.</p>
               <p>MR. TUCKER. I never remember her coming to me, and I never gave the order.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He did; who do you think I could get to forge it? there was Mr. Wright and the beadle there at the time.</p>

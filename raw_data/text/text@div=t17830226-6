               <p>The night that we went to the house of Dudfield, after Dudfield and Levy, and one Reed that is in custody: in the room that Mrs. Dudfield told us, that Levy lodged in we found this trunk, it has been under lock and key ever since, I am sure that is the same trunk: there were five or six trunks, they were all carried to Clark's house, and I carried this to my own house.</p>
               <p>Court. Levy's cloaths were not in it at the time it was found? - Nothing was in it, we had found the other things that were here before, a silk gown and coat, they were found in Dudfield's drawers, in the same house, a pair of sattin slippers, a handkerchief and napkin, and a remnant of linen, (the gown and coat and slippers deposed to by Mrs. Powsey, the slippers having her name in them, which had been endeavored to be rubbed out, and she said she knew the gown by the trimming.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you put the trimming on yourself, madam? - No, sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>I suppose it is like any other trimming that any mantua maker puts on? - It is not very usual.</p>
               <p>Is it in the same situation as it was when you had it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then at present it would not fit you? - No, sir, it would not.</p>
               <p>Only that trimming is like your trimming? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You bought that gown I suppose at some mercers in town? - I bought it at Bellamy's in Chandos-street.</p>
               <p>There is a great deal more of the same piece I suppose? - Perhaps there may.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Macmanus. Who did you see in the house? - Mrs. Dudfield.</p>
               <p>It was a woman in the house that you chuse to call Mrs. Dudfield; were either of the prisoners there? - No.</p>
               <p>Then they did not hear what this woman said? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. I suppose she gave you the trunk to carry them home in? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you by the trunk? - The trunk I have had a long time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, of 2, Stoneleigh-cottages, Twickenham. On Sunday evening, 17th Oct., about a quarter past 6 o'clock, I left my house; the two back doors were bolted with two bolts on each door—I let myself out at the front door, which has a spring lock; I am sure I shut it; I pushed it with my hand—I took the key with me, and left no one in the house—I returned in about twenty minutes, and saw a light in my bedroom—I went to Mr. M'Crae, next door, and asked him to come with me—I do not know whether he went in; I stopped in the garden, and he went to the house—I went in about twenty minutes afterwards, and found my clothes lying on the floor of my bedroom, and a drawer broken open, in which I kept the articles I have lost—I had seen them there that day; they belonged to my son in law.</p>

                  </hi>. I am private watchman to the Dowager Duchess of Northumberland, and live at Isleworth. On Sunday evening, 17th Oct., about 20 minutes to 7 o'clock, I was called by Mr. Tutton, of the Anchor Brewery—I followed him to Mrs. Lamb's house—I was told there was some one there, and I put my foot against the front door post, and laid hold of the knocker—some young men laid hold of the door—I heard some one inside unlock the door, and try to get out—I held on, but some person got this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) between the door and the door post—I tried to get it back again—the man that had the poker in his hand said twice, "D—n your eyes, shoot;" and as he said that, the two young men who had hold of the door ran away—they were stronger inside than I was—they wrenched the door open, and pulled the door towards them, and two men rushed out—as they came out, this poker, which was in one of their hands, poked me in the chest—I got one by his coat, and the other by his collar—the first one got away—I held the second one by the collar, till several persons sang out that he was a young man well respected, and a neighbour; and I let him go, and assisted in taking another, who was in the yard—the one I had by the coat, and who got from me, did not get away from the premises—somebody else stopped him, and I helped to take him—the prisoner is the man—I am posi<lb></lb>tive of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Mulberry Tree, which is near Mrs. Lamb's. On Sunday evening, 2nd Oct., I heard a report, and went to Mrs. Lamb's; it is a cottage with a small garden in front, which is entered by a gate—as soon as I entered the gate, I saw a man open the door from within, with a candle in his hand; he had a very long sharp nose—he closed the door—my husband called to two young men who were passing, to hold the door, so that they could not get out, while he went round to the back—a short time afterwards I saw that the light was out, and in a short time afterwards I saw it again—the door was then opened, and the first person I saw was the prisoner and then another man, and, I fancied, a woman—that was at the time the people were pulling as the door—the prisoner came out first; that was the first time I had seen him—Mr. M'Crae and a roan named Green took him—directly the door opened, they called out, "Shoot, fire!"—the police came, and the prisoner was given into custody—I entered Mrs. Lamb's house, and picked up a gold pin; the house appeared a little disordered, and I saw a large writing desk that had been broken open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understand the person you saw with the light was not the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; in the confusion I cannot exactly say who the other man who came out was, but I saw them both together, and I lost sight of the other: but Mrs. Hogg seized him, and I took hold of him behind; he said, "Let me go, I am well known, now is time for the police;" or, "I will see for the police," and he got away—I was able to see the prisoner so as to say he is the man.</p>

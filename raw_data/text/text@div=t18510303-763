                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On 27th Jan. he came home, put his coat on a chair, and walked into the back-yard—I saw two persons respectably dressed outside, one of whom I had seen on the Thursday before, who came into the shop when Mr. Harriss was not at home—it was the prisoner—he had come in, and asked for the master, and said he wanted a suit of clothes made—I said he was not at home, and he said he would call again as he came from his dinner, but he did not—that was about two o'clock—on this occasion, the 27th, he came in, and I saw a man outside keeping an eye on him and me—the prisoner said, "Is the master at home?"—I said, "Yes," and waited to see if my husband would come, as I saw a man peeping through the window—he did not come, and I went through a little passage to the back-door to call my husband; he came immediately—the prisoner, who was keeping the door half open, asked him what he would charge to make him a suit of clothes with his own cloth—he said 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner said it was very reason<lb></lb>able, and he would call to-morrow to be measured—when my husband came in, he was going to shut the door; I said, "Don't shut the door, because there is a gentleman outside, a companion of this gentleman, waiting for him"—my husband looked out to see if he could see him—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "No, he is gone in somewhere to wait for me," but I saw some one going away while my husband was shutting the door—he passed the door as my husband was shutting it—he seemed to have something hang<lb></lb>ing on his arm, I could not say what—there was time for the prisoner to have given the coat to the other man while I went to call my husband—On the Saturday week following" the prisoner came again, but very differently attired—my husband was not at home.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were your depositions read over to you before you signed them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I swear that—I signed them because I was in haste to go home, having left my infant at home—I had not mentioned about seeing the man outside—the depositions were taken very short—there are no particulars whatever—the Magistrate would not hear half I had to say—he only asked me one question, which was, whether I knew the young man, and why I did not recognise him before—the depositions were taken in the chief-clerk's room, not before the Magistrate—the prisoner had no coat nor hat on at the station—he looked very different, and I could not identify him; I could if I had approached nearer to him; I told the policeman I would not identify him, that was because I did not want the trouble of attending; and I went home and tried to persuade my husband not to, but he would not be persuaded from it, and identified him the moment he saw him—when the prisoner called on the Saturday week after the robbery, he sat down and wrote a scrawl, which he pat in his pocket, and then he wrote another—he was not in the same clothes, but I knew his features.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This was a passage leading into George-yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is pretty dark there? - A. It is very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner before that day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were a little alarmed, were not you? - A. No; I have gone through there five hundred times, and never was alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not this passage so narrow that it is impossible for two or three men to pass without rubbing one against the other? - A. Yes; that is the reason why I discovered my pocket-book was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that that man had his hands in your pocket? - A. I have sworn it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you lay hold of his hand then? - A. I would if I could, but he was too quick for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched afterwards? - A. Yes; before the Lord-Mayor, at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet, though you knew the other man had the pocket-book, you suffered him to go away? - A. The pocket-book was brought to me.</p>
               <p>Q. And you charged the man that brought you the pocket-b with being the man that took it? - A. No, I not; it was brought to me at the Jamaica coffee-house; there were a great many conjectures about it, how I should come by it again so suddenly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a wet or a dry day? - A. It was a very dirty day.</p>
               <p>Q. Your pocket-book was quite in the same state in which you lost it? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a manufacturer of perfumery, servant to Mr. Johnson, in Ball-alley, Lombard-street: I am the person that found that pocket-book, which, I believe, to the best of my knowledge is the same pocket-book; I found it under the covered way in Ball-alley, about three steps from the door of the academy; it was between one and two o'clock, I was going out to my dinner, when I found it; a gentleman saw me pick it up; and I carried it to the Jamaica coffee-house, and delivered it to Mr. Young.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You found it in the covered way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was pretty clear it could not have been given to any person, and carried away? - A. I know nothing how it came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he charge you with stealing it in the coffee-house? - A. No; when I took it in, the gentleman that saw me find it, said, here is the person who has found it; he said, I do not know how he should find it, for it has never been upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. And you swear you did find it in Ball-alley? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Young). Q. Look at that pocket-book? - A. It is mine, it has my name in it, wrote by my clerk the day after I bought it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

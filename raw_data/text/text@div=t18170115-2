On the night of the 29th of December last, about ten minutes past three o'clock, I met the prisoner and another man; I was about one hundred yards from the Castle Tavern; he had a sack with him. I asked the prisoner where he was going with it, he said, to Ealing. East looked into the sack, and said, he had got glass in it. I took him into custody.</p>

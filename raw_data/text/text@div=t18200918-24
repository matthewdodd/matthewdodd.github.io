            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 28th of July the prisoner pledged a pair of bronze candlesticks with me for 1 l. I asked very particularly if they were his own, and if he ever sold any of the sort; he said Yes, and wanted to sell me them, but I would not purchase them, he said he was the maker, and had just set up, and at this season trade was bad; when he left I went to see if he had given me a right direction, and found no such person; he called in a few days with a very handsome pair, I told him he gave me a wrong direction last time, he said he had not. I said it was strange no one should know him; he persisted that he lived there, and said if I would call at five o'clock in the evening he should be at home, and would shew me what he had for sale, but in case he was not at home to ask for the name of Blabrook, and he would tell me where to find him; I thought he seemed to be correct, and went at five o'clock, but then no one knew him. I went about the street enquiring, and at last came to where Blabrook lived, he was not at home. I went at nine o'clock, and described the man to Blabrook he was in the bronze way, and said he worked with him; I told him the prisoner had offered me some goods, he seemed astonished, and said he had no doubt but he had them from his employer. I told him to tell his master to call upon me.</p>

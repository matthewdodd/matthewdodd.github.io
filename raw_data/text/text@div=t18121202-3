            . I am a Thames police officer. On the 29th of October, between four and five in the morning. I was in a boat in the river Thames. The moon shone at the time. I saw the three prisoners jump out of a tea lighter, that lay along side of a barge, at Lady Parson's stairs. The name of the lighter was the Nell. The three prisoners jumped out of the lighter into a skiff, and immediately, as the boat passed me, I discovered something floating on the river, which I picked up. It was two bags; they contained tea. I then shoved after the skiff, wherein was Stapp, the watchman. He had put the two Palmers into a boat. I left Stapp in the skiff, in charge of

Two shawls were found on Stapp, and a ripping chissel, a sail needle, and a case. I afterwards went to Mr. Beckitt, the prosecutor, and I accompanied him to the lighter, where I saw the prisoners come from. I found there a chest of tea had been broken open, and some tea had been scattered about in the hold of the lighter. The chest of tea is here, and this is the tea that I took from them. The tea appears to be the same sort as the tea in the chest.</p>

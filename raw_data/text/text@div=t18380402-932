                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Westminster-bridge-road, and am single. About two o'clock in the day, on the 6th of March, I was in water-lane, Blackfriars—there was a pressure on my left shoulder, and then on my right—I put my hand to my pocket, and my purse was gone, with our sovereigns and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw Harris, and I suppose he was one of those pressing—only two appeared to be pressing—Harris was one—the purse was on my right hand—he was on the right also—he was running way, and my purse was gone—he put his hand into my pocket I suppose—me one put his hand in—I am quite sure Harris was on the right—I do not know who was on the left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at No. 6, Union-street. I was standing by my counting-house, and looked out of the shop—I saw Harris walk deliberately up to this lady, and put his hand into her pocket behind, or cut it, and take out a brown purse, and swing it round—I ran out, and said,"Madam, you are robbed"—I ran, and took Harris in Bride-lane—Atkins was there—I cannot say what situation he was in—they trip<lb></lb>ped me up, and I fell with Atkins—there were several of them about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were the first person who gave information to this lady? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know whether I knocked Atkins down—I threw Harris down—I do not know that I knocked him down—there were not many persons about the lady except these—there were a great many people in my shop—there were other people at the back of my shop—I suppose he handed the purse away—the same persons were brought up at Guildhall—I did not cause them to be taken—a man named Crawley took them—I did not tell him to take any other one—I was very much confused.</p>

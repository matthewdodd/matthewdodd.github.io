            . I am the prosecutor's servant. I saw the prisoner in the kitchen, and asked what he wanted, he said he wanted the tap-room, I showed it to him. He asked if a man in a green coat had been there; I said No. I went to get him half a pint of beer. As I was going out of the room, I met him coming out. I went into the room and missed the candlesticks off the table, and told my mistress; she went out and brought him back.</p>

On the 4th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, the servant gave me some information. I went out and took the prisoner outside the door. I asked what he had got. He said he had something to sell. I took his bag from him, and found my four candlesticks in it. He ran away, and was secured immediately. I am sure he is the man.</p>

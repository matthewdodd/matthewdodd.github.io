                  </hi>. I was residing at the Tavistock Hotel at the time in question. On Friday, the 2nd of December, I obtained some money at Esdaile's bank, a little before two o'clock, and placed it in my right-hand waistcoat pocket—I had a riding-coat on, which I buttoned—I then went to the west end of the town, to leave London, by a coach from the White Horse Cellar, about a quarter past three o'clock—I arrived there half an hour before three o'clock, and I went to lounge away the tine at the picture-shop at the corner of Sackville-street—I had taken off my Macintosh cloak, and had it over my arm, and my coat was un but-toned—while I was at the picture-shop I felt a pressure—I left the people who were about me, and put my hand to my waistcoat pocket, and the notes were gone—they were safe a few minutes before—I went back' to Esdaile's to get the numbers and dates of the notes, and stop their payment—one was a £100 note, and the other a £50 note—I had taken the numbers of them before, but it was written in pencil, and being effaced I thought it was best to go back to Esdaile's—these are the notes (<hi rend="italic">Looking at them.</hi>)</p>

               <p>Ward. He must have been very close to me to see what I had in my apron - it was a few French beans.</p>
               <p>Witness. I cannot say what he had got; he met some girl of the town, and showed her what he had got.</p>

             (Police-constable K 61).

               <p>Ward's Defence. No one saw me with the property, nor with these two boys; when the officer saw me, he asked what I had in my apron - I said Nothing; he knocked first at one door, and then at another, and when Foley opened a door, he ran in, and said, "This is the house you came out of."</p>
               <p>Foley's Defence. The officer stated at the Thames Police-office that I ran up stairs; but instantly I opened the door, he laid hold of me, and said there is another of them - I had been with Pickard, and left him, and went home to go to bed; he then came again to ask me to go to swim; I knew nothing of Ward till the officer brought him in.</p>

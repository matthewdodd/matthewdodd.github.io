            . I am a country fellow, upon the 6th of June, I was enquiring for a place about the Minories; a man, whose name is M'Oris, came to me, and told me, if I would go with him into a public house in <placeName id="t17750712-36-crimeloc162">Queen-street</placeName>

We then went to the Hoop and Horse Shoe, and there they began to play at shaking a halfpenny, and putting it under the candlestick; then M'Oris said, he hoped Gibbons would do by him, as he did by the gentleman the night before; that was, give him a shilling for every guinea he could show; then M'Oris pulled out two guineas and an half, and he gave him two shillings; then M'Oris said, Gibbons was a captain, and he gave countrymen a shilling for every guinea they could shew. I then pulled out two guineas and an half, and he was to give me half a crown, when the landlord came in; then they invited me to play with them, I told them, I did not choose to play at all; they played again, and M'Oris said to me, let me have your money; no, I said, I did not chuse that at all; upon that, he took hold of my left hand, and took the money out of my hand; he held the money in his hand, and shewed it to Gibbons, and said, see this young man has two guineas and a half, I hope you will do by him as you did by me; one of them asked me what o'clock it was, I pulled out my watch to see, and put it in again? as soon as I had put it in, M'Oris took hold of the chain and pulled it out, and said, it was a good watch, and threw the watch and money into Gibbons's hat; then they walked together up and down the room with the money and watch; I said, they had taken my money and watch, and I did not chuse to loose it in that manner; then M'Oris bid me come to the door; when we came to the door, there was the landlord and a constable waiting to take them for swindling somebody else. I told the landlord they had taken my watch and money. Gibbons was taken, but M'Oris got off. When Gibbons was taken to the watch-house, he dropped a parcel of counterfeit guineas in the coal tub, I never saw my money nor watch after they walked up and down the room, together with it. On Friday following, as I was going to work at the cooper's in Barnaby-street, about five o'clock in the morning, three fellows overtook me on London bridge, and asked me if my name was not so and so, and if I had not lost my watch; I said, yes; they said, if I would go with them they would let me have my watch again; I told them, I did not chuse to go with them; they said, it was but a little way, and if I would release Gibbons out of prison, I should have my watch and money again. I then observed the chain, seals and key of my watch, hang out of one of their pockets; the key is a very remarkable one; it being very early in the morning, I was afraid to attempt to stop them, lest they should knock my brains out, or use me ill.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. He swore to an innocent man before Justice Sherwood.</p>
               <p>Grabham. I took up a man who I thought to be the other man, and swore to the best of my knowledge he was one of them; and to the best of my knowledge h e is; I know the prisoner is one of the men, he never departed the room till he was taken.</p>

            . I keep the Hoop and Horse Shoe, Tower-hill. On the 6th of June, the prisoner and M'Oris came to my house; I have often seen them there; I suspected them to be sharpers; I got a constable to take them up, when they came out. M'Oris made his escape; we took Gibbons, and carried him to the watch-house; he was not searched in my house, but when we came to the watch-house, he dropped a purse of counters into the coal basket, and he was searched, and a draught found upon him.</p>

            . I know nothing of the prisoner, the prosecutor took me up for another person, who was concerned with the prisoner, and swore positively that I was the person that defrauded him of his watch and money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor called on me one Sunday in prison, and told me, the man that had run away with the property, had sent a friend to offer him the watch and money, not to pursue the prosecution; he said, he was afraid to do that, because of his recognizance; but if I would send the watch and money to him, he would not appear against me; I will call a person to prove that.</p>
               <p>- Roberts. Last Sunday was week, I went down to Clerkenwell Bridewell, while I was there, the prosecutor came in and enquired for the prisoner, he came down the yard, and the prosecutor said, well Mr. Gibbons, how do you like this; he said, not at all; the prosecutor said, well, if you will, tell me where the man is, that has got my watch and money, I will endeavour to get you out, and if you will give me my watch and money, I will not appear against you; he said, he should not be hurt, if he could help it, but that he could not do any thing without consulting his friends; he said, he did not think he took it, but he believed he knew where the man was, that did take it.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Roberts. I am a labourer, I live in Vine-Street, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Every word this man has said, is totally false, I never said he was not the person that took the money; I had occasion to go to Clerkenwell, and called on Gibbons, and asked him, whether he liked being there better than swindling, and robbing people.</p>

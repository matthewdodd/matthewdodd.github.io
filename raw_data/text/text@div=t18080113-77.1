            . I am constable of St. Martin's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember this woman being brought to the watchhouse. - A. Yes, about nine o'clock on the 3rd of January, by Morgan and a number of people besides. I searched her; in her right hand pocket I found three shillings and sixpence, and I found a shilling in her left hand pocket; I then unloosed her clothes and shook her petticoats, and down dropped this five shillings; the watchhouse keeper picked them up and gave them to me. I produce the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Last Monday night, I was standing in Long Acre with a young woman, about half after eight this young man came up to us, and asked me where was Long Acre; I told him he was in Long Acre; he asked me if I lived far from there; I told him I did not; then he asked me if I had a room of own, I told him I had not; he said he would give me a shilling for his pleasure, which he did; after that he very much ill used me, and coming into the street, he took me to the watchhouse; this money I had saved up ever since Christmas last to buy me a gown; he has sworn so false, I must leave it to the jury.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is no pretence for making it a highway robbery, if you believe his story she picked his pocket; she took the opportunity as they were walking towards the place to take his purse out of his pocket; there is no doubt but what she stole it, if you believe the prosecutors story; but you will acquit her of the highway robbery. He says he was sober when it happened.</p>

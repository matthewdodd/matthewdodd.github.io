               <p>half-past four in the afternoon, I went with Brannan, Cole, and two other officers, to a house in John's-buildings, St. Ann-street, Westminster—I tried the door, and could not open it—I consider it was locked—I then forced it open, with the assistance of the other officers—the house consists of two rooms—we went to the upstairs room, and found that door fast—I found it was fastened with this wooden cross-bar across the door—this larpe piece of timber about eight feet long was fitted into it, and went in a slanting direction to the wall—the door was broken open by Brannan with a sledge-hammer—as soon as a piece of the door was knocked out I had a full view of the room—I saw Thomas Russell throw a quantity of shillings into a large clear fire—I could see they were shillings—the pri<lb></lb>soners were in the room—Ann Russell had a mould in her hand at the time, which she put into a pail of water in front of the fire and squeezed it—the door then came in, and we rushed in—I put my hand into the pail of water and took out a shilling, and some plaster of Paris which she had in her hand—I then commenced searching the room—under the bed by the I found a paper parcel containing plaster of Paris in powder, and this knife on the floor close to the fire with plaster of Paris on it—on a kind of dresser<lb></lb>shelf I found this galvanic battery in a jar containing fluid, which in the affray was accidentally upset—I had it in my hand before it was shirt, and it was quite full—the male prisoners had their coats off, and their shirt sleeves rolled up—I did not see Scott till I entered the room—he was in the corner of the room where the bed was—when I entered, Thomas Russell was Just in front of the fire, and Scott was in a kind of place where the bed was—Russell had a handkerchief tied round his head—I ascertained the state of the door after I got in—I produce the things I found.</p>

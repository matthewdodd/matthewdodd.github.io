                  </hi>. I am a Custom-house officer, and live in Water-street. About half-past six o'clock in the evening of the 16th of October I was going over Westminster-bridge—my attention was called by Walker, and I missed a silk handkerchief from my coat pocket, which was safe ten minutes before.</p>

The other had a smock-frock, which I tore down in his endeavouring to escape—I am confident the prisoner took it—I did not lose sight of him till I seized them—the prisoner got hold of my legs, to get me down, while the other pulled away from me.</p>

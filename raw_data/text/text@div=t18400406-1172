                  </hi>. I live in Bridge-street, Southwark. On the 25th of March; about four o'clock, I was passing through Thames-street—Mr. Morgan, who was in a wagon, called out to me that my pocket was picked—I turned, and the two prisoners were dose behind me, and no one else was so near to me as they were—I seized Burton, and, with the assistance of another person, we kept them till the policeman came—we found nothing on them, but my handkerchief was found in a house close to where I seized Barton—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

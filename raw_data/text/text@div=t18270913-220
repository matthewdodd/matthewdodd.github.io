            . I am the prosecutrix's daughter. The prisoner came to our house that evening, and sent me out three times for a young woman whom she knew. I did not go far the first time, but came back and said I did not see her. I went as far as the Star and Garter public-house the second time; and the third time, as I returned, I met the prisoner with a bundle in my mother's red handkerchief - this was a little after eight o'clock; she asked if I had seen the woman - I said Yes. I went home and missed the things, which were safe when I went out.</p>

            . On the 15th of July, I was in the back room of this house where I lodge; the prisoner came in and told a young man and I, who were writing a letter, to come into the front room, as we should be quiet - we did so, and in a few minutes we came into the front room. I saw her tying up a bundle - I knew nothing of her before; she brought the bundle, and put something on my box. I went up stairs, and as I came down, saw her going out - I followed and enquired for her.</p>

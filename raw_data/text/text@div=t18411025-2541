On the 2nd of October the prisoner came to my shop, and asked if I had got any good second-hand watches—I told him we bad—he said he was recommended by Mr. Rolls, a carrier, down below—I showed him a watch, he asked the price—I told him four gui<lb></lb>neas—he liked it very well—I showed him another—he said he hardly knew which to have—he determined on one, and left 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he would call in half-an-hour—he came, and said, "Is the watch ready?"—he said he did not know whether he would take that or the other—I showed him the two—he then asked me to give him a glass of water, as he was a tee-totaller—I did not like that, and I did not give it him—I shut the door—he asked me again—I sent a boy up stairs for the water—the prisoner then took both the watches, hit roe oh the side of my head, and ran away with them—he was taken in Jewin-crescent—he threw these watches (now produced) away—they were picked up—they are my master's.</p>

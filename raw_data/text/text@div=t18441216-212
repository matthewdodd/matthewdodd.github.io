ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner employed in the bank in Sep<lb></lb>tember last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was—his duty was such as to give him access to all the ledgers in the Transfer-office; and were he to go to any particular ledger, no question would be asked him, conceiving it was his duty to do so—he was employed in the Power of Attorney office—he would know the whole course of business, and could furnish himself with whatever par<lb></lb>ticulars he wanted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he at any time apply to you for leave of absence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—I am not certain whether it was on Saturday, the 31st of Aug., or Mon<lb></lb>day, the 2nd of Sept.—the probability is that it was on Monday, the 2nd of Sept.—he asked leave from the 3rd of Sept. to the 5th, which he had given him—he did not return at the end of his leave.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long you have been in the employment of the bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Forty-three years—the Three per Cent. Consol office is a separate room to the Power of Attorney office, in which the prisoner's business was performed—it is not in a separate part of the building, it is contiguous—it may he said to be a separate office, though intimately connected with the Transfer-office—he had a duty to perform in the Consol-officein going to put limitations on Power of Attorney, and for various other inquiries that he clerks in the office may call on him for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> His duty was with reference to powers of attorney gene<lb></lb>rally for every species of stock, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—in order to enable him to perform his duty with reference to the preparations of proper power of attorney, he would have access to the books, showing the different state of accounts, as well as the Consols—he would go into the Consol-office, take up the ledger, and open it, and no question would be asked, the clerks considering it part and parcel of his duty—if he was instructed to prepare a power of attorney for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for A. B., part of a sum of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would have authority to examine the books, in order to see if A. B. was entitled to such a sum.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Consol-office in the Bank, on the 3rd of Sept. I received from Mr. Sutton, a clerk in the same office, two tickets—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—these are them—I received them from him for the purpose of effecting a transfer—they are usually deposited in a box, and we take them out as we are going on entering—these came into my possession from Mr. Sutton—he was somewhere about the Transfer<lb></lb>office passing over tickets—I saw the prisoner in the Transfer-office at that time—I am uncertain whether I received the tickets from the hand of Mr. Sutton, or whether I may have taken them from the box, but they came direct from him—I received them in the Transfer-office—I am employed in the Transfer-office—the prisoner was not in the office at that time—he made his appearance a few minutes afterwards—I happened to have the number of tickets in my hand when he came up—there were several other clerks assisting there, and he came up and inquired who entered stock for the name of Oxenford—I replied that I did—I had these tickets then in my hand—he then asked me if I would oblige him by entering them directly, as Mr. Oxenford was waiting—I therefore proceeded to enter them in the Transfer-book—whilst he was waiting I asked him if he knew Mr. Oxenford, having known the name many years ago, before I was in the Bank—he replied that he did—he was an old friend of his—I said, "He must be getting an old man now"—he said he was—when I had completed it I said, "Where is Mr. Oxenford?"—he said he was outside minding the horse—that he (meaning himself) had got an early off that day, and they were going down to Gravesend together—I supposed by that that he had done his business for the day, and had leave to go away early—he then went out to fetch Mr. Oxenford, and shortly returned with a gentleman, and asked me for the book—he then asked, "What gentleman will see it?"—it is the custom that one clerk should witness the transfer, and that another person, in attendance with the party transferring, should witness his identity—it must be some person known to the Bank—the prisoner took the book and took it to Mr. Ingall, another clerk, who was close by, sitting in the same office—at the same time I heard him say to the person who had come into the office, "Come along, <hi rend="italic">Willey</hi>," or some such expression as that, "it is all ready"—I saw him and the other person come up together—I did not myself witness the act of the transfer of this stock—I did not see the signature—I after wards accompanied John Forrester, the officer, to the United States—we left London on the 18th of Sept.—we ultimately went to Boston, and found Elder in Federal-street, No. 51 (we had been to a variety of other places first)—it was on a Thursday, about the end of Oct.—he was passing by the name of Ellis—I recognised him as the man who had come into the Bank with the prisoner, after his going out to fetch Oxenford, who he said was minding the horse—I told Forrester that he was the man—Forrester took him by the coat and said, "Your name is Joseph Elder, and you are lately from London"—he was afterwards committed to prison, and I heard afterwards that he had destroyed himself—I went with Forrester to Nahant where the prisoner escaped from, but did not go up to Brewster's Island.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Consol-office. I was in the Consol Transfer-office on Tuesday, the 3rd of Sept., and remember seeing the prisoner there—when I first saw him he was a few feet from me, on the public side of the counter—there was a person with him—I knew the prisoner well, but not the other person—the prisoner called my attention by saying, "Perhaps, Mr. Ingall, you will see this?* (meaning, that I would perhaps witness the transfers)—he bad the transfer receipts in his hand—the book was on the counter—I took the receipts from him—I have no recollection of answering him—the person he had brought with him then signed these transfers "William Oxenford"—my place at the counter was about six or seven feet from where Mr. Bord stood.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the book transferred from Mr. Bord to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> So far as I recollect, the prisoner merely brought the book a little nearer to me, but did not come immediately opposite to me—he brought the book from Mr. Bord, and I think he brought it forward, and placed it in the position in which it was signed by Elder—the prisoner, in the meantime, or immedi­ ately after, read to me the amount transferred, from this book, and the names into which the amount was going, and I checked him on the stock receipt or tickets which I had in my hand at the time—these are the tickets that I had in my hand at the time—my signatures are to them—the amount transferred is, (<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>,) "6305<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to George Shum Storey, John Petty Musprat, William Cotton, and Matthew Whiting"—I found that cor­ responded with one of the receipts I had in my hand—nothing had passed between me and the prisoner, before this, as to who the person was that he brought—after the person had signed the transfer, the prisoner wrote in "William Oxenford," and his own name at the back, as the witness to the identity of William Oxenford, the person making the transfer—this is it—"Witness to the identity of W. Oxenford, W. Burgess, Bank"—the words "Witness to the identity" are in print; the name "W. Oxenford" was written in ink by the prisoner, and then he signed his own-name, describ­ ing himself as of the Bank—when he had signed his name, the book was turned round by the prisoner to me, to examine the transfer, to see that it had the signature of William Oxenford, that he was properly identified, and that the witness to the identity was named there—I signed it as the attesting witness—I then handed the prisoner the receipts, of which this is one, and he walked away—I had previously signed my name to it—I do not recollect whether the receipt was signed before it was placed in my hand, nor do I recollect seeing Elder sign it—it was signed as it now ap­ pears when it was in my hand, with the exception of my own signature—I put my signature to it at the time the prisoner read the amount from the transfer-book, and I checked it on the receipt—that receipt was handed by me to the prisoner—it had been signed by Elder, in the name of Oxen<lb></lb>ford,</p>

Q.</hi> I understand you to say that you do not remem<lb></lb>ber seeing this receipt signed by anybody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not—I have wit<lb></lb>nessed the signature of the party—it is constantly the case that receipts are brought and not signed in our presence—it is frequently the practice for brokers to come with persons who are about to transfer, with the receipts already signed at their office—they acknowledge it as their receipts, of course—this was passed over to me, and I assumed it to be right, and put my name to it as the witness—I was not noticing this transaction from the time the application was made to Mr. Bord—Mr. Bord was about six or seven feet from me—he was not the very next person attending to business; there was one between us at the counter at the time, Mr. Tom<lb></lb>kins—these books lie on the counter in the office, and are pushed along from one to the other as they are required—the book would be presented towards the public side of the counter for the transfer to be executed—I have a very considerable number of these transactions in the course of a day, at times—I do not generally keep hold of a corner of the book while the party is signing, and then draw it back to its right position opposite myself—I have very rarely held the book while a party is signing it—as soon as it is signed, I quite as often draw it back as the party pushes it back—I certainly do not watch the party, to see, more than is necessary for the transaction of the particular business—the book is either draws back by ourselves, or returned by the broker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At this distance of time I suppose you cannot say in which way this particular transaction was done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as my recollection serves me, Burgess turned the book round—I think I can be positive of it—to the best of my recollection he did so—I will swear positively that he did so—there was nothing remarkable in this transaction to call my attention to it—I cannot tell how many transfers took place in our office that day, because I am not engaged in the whole of them—I cannot tell how many I was engaged in—I should imagine there must have been a good many after this on that day, because it was a heavy day with us—it is impos­ sible to say whether the transfers appear in the book in the order in which they were-made in the office, except with regard to these two—I do not find one just before or after it in which I have been the attesting witness—whatever 1 attend to I put my name to—I do not see any other in this book that day which I put my name to—I see no other in this book except these two transfers of William Oxenford—there appears to have been six other transfers that day—it does not appear by these entries that I witnessed any except those of Oxenford—there are other books in which I probably witnessed on that day—without looking at the books I cannot say whether I did or not, but the probability is that I did—I do not positively remember—to the best of my belief I should say I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you remember, in any one instance that occurred that day, whether the party coming pushed the book to you, or you drew it back, with the single exception of this transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot, nor on the day before, nor the day after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you explain, then, what there was peculiar about this transac­ tion to enable you to swear with any degree of positiveness as to how the book was treated on the occasion of this particular transfer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The thing came to light in a few days after; and I endeavoured, as well as I</p>

               <p>possibly could, to bring to my mind all the circumstances that had taken place—I was examined before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this the first time you have stated that fact of the prisoner's pushing the book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect whether I was asked the ques­ tion before—I cannot positively recollect whether this is the first time I have stated that the book was handed or pushed to me by the prisoner—I think it is.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stock-jobber, and have been so for nearly forty years. I know the prisoner, by his entering my tickets in the Three and a Half Reduced—I know nothing more of him than as a Bank clerk—he called on me when I was standing in the Bank, at the latter part of Aug., and said that he had a friend who wanted to raise 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had 8200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., stock—I do not think a word passed beyond that—I had no further conversation with him at that time—he left me immediately—on Tuesday, the 3rd of Sept., I saw him in the street, at the foot of the Bank steps—he brought me a ticket, filled up in the regular way, for the purpose of the sale of 8200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock—it was a ticket of this sort, the ordinary transfer ticket that is used at the Bank—I did not notice what name it was in—I noticed the amount in figures—I immediately passed it to Clement Smith, who is a stock-jobber, and we agreed as to the purchase, at, I think, at 98 7-8ths, the price of the day—I calculated the amount that would be in money—it was 8107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards received from Mr. Smith, in the course of the day, two receipts—this is one of them—it was not then signed—I gave them to the prisoner, to go into the Consol-office, to make the transfer—I believe at the time I gave him the receipts I was standing at the bottom of the Bank steps, in Bartholomew-lane—there was a crowd of persons about there—I do not know that any party was in his company—he took the receipts from me—when he came back from the Transfer-office he brought me the same two receipts—I was then standing on the Bank steps—they were then regularly signed and witnessed by the clerk—I believe at that time he had a friend with him, but I never spoke to him—I saw a person with him—nothing passed—the prisoner gave me the receipts, and I passed them to Henry Smith, the son of Clement Smith, to go and fetch me the money—the prisoner told me he would wait at the Auction-mart Coffee­ house for the money—I afterwards received this check (looking at it) for 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; from Clement Smith, also a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash—I took them to the Auction-mart Coffee-room—I there found the prisoner sitting down with the same man that was with him when he brought me the receipts—I put the money on the table before them—his friend took up the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. check, and the prisoner took the cash and the Bank notes—he never told me who the other person was—I had no con<lb></lb>versation with him whatever.</p>

               <p>Charles Chatham Lawrence. I am one of the cashiers at the banking-house of Sir John Lubbock and Co. On Tuesday, the 3rd of Sept. last, about twenty minutes before two o'clock, this check for 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was brought to me by two persons; the prisoner was one, the other was a person of about forty-five or fifty years of age—the prisoner had a carpet<lb></lb>bag, on which he was leaning on the counter—it appeared to me to be empty—we always ask the name of parties presenting checks—I did so on this occasion, and the name of "Oxenford" was given—it was the pri<lb></lb>soner's companion who presented the check to me, and who gave that name—I asked how he would like it, and he replied, "Part or all in gold "—I said, "If you want part or all in gold, you had better have large notes, and get the whole of it at the Bank of England"—I eventually gave them eight notes of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I put them into the hands of the person who accompanied the prisoner, in his presence—these eight cancelled notes are the notes I paid on that occasion—(these were Nos. 22201, to No. 22208, all dated 13th May, 1844)—the prisoner's companion counted over the notes in his presence, and before he left the counter, I saw him write something in the corner of the notes, in the prisoner's presence—I did not see what he wrote—to the best of my recollection, it was his companion who counted the notes and wrote in the corner of them—(looking at a carpet-bag produced)—the bag on which I saw the prisoner leaning was such a one as this; that was the prevailing colour and pattern of the bag—I do not speak to its identity, but it was that sort of colour and pattern—the prisoner's companion was a man I should judge about my own height, about 5ft. 9in.; but being on the other side of the counter, I could not exactly judge of his height; he had a ruddy complexion, and was a well-looking man—I did not observe particularly whether he was stout or thin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live in George-street, Portman-square. I knew a person named Joseph Elder for three or four years—I did not know his business—I believe he was a dealer in horses—I know the prisoner—I first became acquainted with him about the same time as Elder—they went to the same house as I was in the habit of using—I first met the prisoner at Mr. Warren's, the George Townsend public-house, Oxford-street—Elder, I believe, lodged there—I knew but little of the prisoner till September, 1843, when I met him at Margate—he was then in company with Elder—I had seen him previously at the George Townsend in company with Elder—about three or four months after I came from Margate, Elder and the prisoner called at my house one evening—Elder asked if I knew any one who could accommodate the pri­ soner with board and lodging, or if I could myself—I said I did not know any one, and had not room myself, but if I had a vacancy I would let him know—in July last I had a vacancy, and left a letter at hit lodg<lb></lb>ings—he afterwards came to lodge at my house in July—I had seen him and Elder together at other places after they applied about the lodg­ ing—after the prisoner came to lodge at my house, Elder called to see him several times—I remember Sunday the 1st of Sept.—I saw Elder there about a quarter to one o'clock in the day—the prisoner and Elder were sitting just within my shop door—as soon as I opened my parlour door, and went into the parlour from the passage, they rose up and said, "Let us go up stairs"—the shop door was open, and they were sitting in the shop—it is a back shop door, leadsing into the parlour—Burgess's lodging was up stairs—they remained up stairs about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I rung the bell for Burgess to come down to dinner—he knew what the bell meant—they both came down together—Elder was going away—I asked him to stop dinner, which he did—after dinner I laid down on the sofa, and while lying there I heard the prisoner mention the word "power of attorney"—Elder said, "How is it to be done?"—Burgess replied, "It is like placing two boxes on this table, take it out of one, you put it into the other"—there was then some conversation which I did not hear—the next I heard was Elder say, "Is it to be Tuesday or Wednesday?"—Burgess replied, "I do not know, I will tell you to-morrow"—Elder then said to Burgess, "What clothes do you mean to travel in, for I have got no great coat?"—Burgess replied, "No more have I"—Elder said, "I shall wear my loose one" (I had seen him wear a loose coat)—Burgess replied, "I shall wear this over my black one"—he had a loose coat on at the time, a kind of wrapper, which he used to wear—I went out at about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, and left Elder there—while I knew him he went by the name of Joseph Elder—the prisoner knew him by that name—I returned to my house about ten o'clock at night, and found the prisoner there, but did not see Elder—on the Monday, Elder was at my house three times—he called a fourth time, but I did not see him then—he called first about twelve in the day for a bird that Burgess had, but did not take it then—Burgess was not there—he came a second time for the bird, und took it away—he came a third time, in about ten minutes—he had left his umbrella, and returned for it—I saw him and Burgess together that day at the George Townsend in Oxford-street, about ten o'clock at night—I did not hear anything pass between them—Burgess was sitting by my side—Elder</p>

               <p>came to the door and beckoned him out—he went out, they returned in about twenty minutes together, and remained together about an hour—Burgess left with me and went home—I did not see Elder the next day—while the prisoner lived with me I had some money to put in the funds, and got him to bring me home the price of stock—he once told me he had 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Bank—he borrowed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me about a week after he came to lodge with me, and on the 2nd of Sept. he borrowed a sovereign—he went out in the morning of the 3rd of Sept.—he was gone out when I came down stairs—I saw him again a little before nine o'clock—I had been out, and found him in the parlour at breakfast—he went out about half-past nine or ten o'clock, and came in again about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon—he then had a coat on similar to the one he has now, and a blue handkerchief round his neck—he walked to my house—I saw no carriage whatever, but when he went out in the morning he had a driving<lb></lb>whip in his hand—when he came in the afternoon he paid me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, which he owed me—they appeared new sovereigns—he left between half-past three and half-past four o'clock, I believe—I never saw him again till he was at the Mansion-house—when he left my house, he said he should be back that night, he should not be late—he had three sove<lb></lb>reigns in his hand—he showed them to me, and said, "This is all I have got, 1 shall not be late."</p>

I was at Caunt's public-house on the night of the 3rd of Sept., and saw the prisoner there—I was one of the party—we had four bottles of wine and some beef-steaks—I saw the soldier there—I knew Elder before, I had seen him scores of times—he came there about twenty minutes after seven o'clock—he said to Burgess, "I want you to go directly "—he said, "I am coming in five minutes"</p>

               <p>Elder said, "If you don't come I shall go; I have a cab ready at the door"—the prisoner went away with him in a cab—one Grinham was there that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at the Mersey-hotel, at Liver<lb></lb>pool. At half-past five o'clock on the morning of the 4th of Sept., two persons arrived at the Hotel by the London-railway, in a rail way-carriage—the prisoner is one of them—the other was a stout, ruddy-complexioned gentleman, from forty-five to fifty years old I should think—one of them, I do not recollect which, asked me if they could have a private room to take breakfast in, also a place to put their luggage—I noticed none of their luggage except a heavy portmanteau of a dark colour, which I took on my shoulder—it was extremely heavy—I showed them to a private room—I afterwards heard the prisoner ask Mr. Home, the landlord, if he would give him notes for sovereigns—he could not do it, but desired me to show the prisoner to a bullion-dealer—I offered to go with him, but he declined going—he went out by himself—that was about nine o'clock—I did not see what became of his companion—I saw the prisoner again between ten and eleven—his companion was then with him—the prisoner asked me to take his luggage into the boat, to go on board the Britannia steam ship—took his things down—I do not recollect anything particular, but the port­ manteau—I noticed that, owing to the weight of it—I do not remember whether I took anything else or not—I put them on board a small boat, to take them to the Britannia—I saw the boat go out towards the vessel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief officer of the City of London, stationed at the Mansion-house. I received a warrant for the apprehension of two persons, named Burgess and Elder, and, in consequence of instructions, ac­ companied by Mr. Bord, from the Bank, I proceeded to America—I arrived at Halifax, and traced the parties from one place to another, till I arrived at Boston, where I found a person answering to the name of Elder—he was going by the name of Ellis there—on the 31st of Oct. I got into the house where he was lodging, and awaited his arrival, and on his coming home, about one o'clock in the day, 1 apprehended him—I told him I had a warrant against him, and showed it him—I said, "Your name is Joseph Elder "—he said, "It is"—Mr. Bord saw him, and recognised him as soon as he came in—after placing him in a place of security, I searched his lodging, and found 400 sovereigns in this black portmanteau, and some clothes in a cupboard, which I did not take away then—the portmanteau I brought away directly—I found in it some cards, with the name of Ellis on them, and a plate with it—these are some of the cards, and he had some of them on his person—I found letters in the portmanteau addressed to him in the name of Elder, and this discharge under the Insolvent Act—I</p>

               <p>brought some linen here, which is marked "J. E."—I took him before a justice, and proceeded with Mr. Bord and officers from Boston, in search of the prisoner, to Nahant, which is a small peninsula, I think, about four<lb></lb>teen miles from Boston—there is an hotel there—I went to the hotel—the American officer who was with me showed himself at the hotel—I did not see the prisoner there—I stopped there all that night, Thursday, the 31st, and part of the next day—I was about different parts of the island on Friday, and on Friday night I returned to Boston—before that, I saw this carpet-bag at the hotel at Nahant, and left it there—on Saturday I went to a place called Brewsters's Island, which is up the river, about eleven miles from Boston—I had an American officer with me—I went to a kind of wooden hut, or cottage there, and found the prisoner there—he knew me before, and I was acquainted with his person—the officer went in first—I followed, and the prisoner was by the fire—at that time he was without whiskers—when I knew him at the Bank I think he used to wear a little whisker, but I am not positive—I went up to him, and he said to me, "How are you, John?"—I said, "I am very well, but am very sorry to see you in such a situation"—he said, "So am I, but it can't be helped now, old fellow"—we came away together in a boat, and in the boat he asked, "Where Is Elder?"—I said he had made away with himself, which was the fact—I knew it from what I was told—I did not see him dead; he was buried when I came back—the prisoner said, "Well, I think he is a fool for that, he might as well have seen it out"—I searched him, but found nothing particular—I found some bags at Nahant—I brought the prisoner to Boston—he was locked up, and sent before a Ma­ gistrate on Monday morning—after the prisoner was secured I got the carpet bag from the hotel at Nahant—it is the one that has been' produced—130 sovereigns were found at Nahant, and handed over to me by the American officer—I did not see them found—after taking the prisoner be<lb></lb>fore the Magistrate in America, he was entrusted to me to bring to this country—before I came away I obtained possession of 6,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I brought over and delivered to the Governor of the Bank of England—I got it from Mr. Blatchford, agent for Mr. Freshfield, at New York—I had heard the prisoner say there was money in the Bank—he said the money was in the Merchants' Bank at Boston, and be should be very glad to sign it over, for the Bank of England to have it—I think that was before I had got it, but I do not recollect at what part of the transaction—I had no further conversation with him on the subject of the money—I did not go to Nahant with him—I brought him to Boston—I saw Mr. Blatchford long before 1 apprehended the prisoner—I had caused notice to be given about the money being taken—I went with Mr. Bord and a Judge Warren to the prison the prisoner was in, but what passed I do not know—I went to identify Mr. Bord as the gentleman representing the Bank of England, and after that I received from Mr. Blatchford the 6,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I brought to England with the 400 and 120 sovereigns.</p>

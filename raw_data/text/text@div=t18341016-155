            . I am constable of Wilsden. In consequence of what I heard, I went down to Old Oak Common, and met the prisoner with a mare, in a cart, near Wilsden - I met the prisoner in the lane, with two men - the mare was in the field just by - I did not meet the prisoner with it - I met him in possession of Hallett and his son - I said to him, "How came you by this horse?" - he said, "It is my brother's."</p>

            , JUN. I live at Shepherd's Bush. In consequence of something which happened, I made a search, and found the prisoner in Old Oak-lane, about ten minutes past eight o'clock in the morning - he had the mare out of the cart, about one hundred yards from the cart - the prisoner was between the shafts of the cart - he had the collar and traces (but no bridle or saddle) hanging to the shafts of the cart - the mare appeared to have drawn the cart - I asked who that mare belonged to - he said it belonged to him, or his brother, it did not matter which, for they were all one - there was no other horse there - I asked him to go with me - he said he would go with the greatest pleasure - I and my father took him along, and gave him to Brown - Arnold claimed the mare, which the prisoner said belonged to his brother.</p>

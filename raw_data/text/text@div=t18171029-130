            ; our brewhouse is in Portpool-lane, and we have a cellar in John's Mews, Bedford-row; where we deposit store ale in reserve-it was not in the course of delivery at this time.</p>
               <p>JAMES WALKINSHAW. I am a publican, and keep the Surry Arms, in Surry-square, Kent-road. I have dealt with Messrs. Wyatt for four years; I used to pay 4l. per barrel for ale, I always gave the order to the collecting clerk and had it delivered at my house. I used to pay him the money when he came round. The prisoner, Blake, was their drayman; in April last, he brought some ale to my house in the regular way; I was in the cellar, he tapped me on the shoulder, a man named Collins was with him; Blake asked me if I should like to take a barrel or two of him - I asked him what he meant? he said, why I can bring you one or two barrels at half price. I asked him how he got them, he said he could get them from the Firm very well, as he had a good opportunity - I told him I would have nothing to do with it; he begged of me to take no notice - I told him I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. About two months after that-he, and Collins, came with some more ale. He said I was much to blame, as I had such a good opportunity, he could put 4l. or 5l. a week into my pocket regularly, for my house was conveniently situated, as he was passing the house to Greenwich; he then said, "you have got a family, and it will be of great help to you;" I told him it was my family that I considered, and I would have nothing to do with it on any account whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. On the 4th of September, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning; I thought they came for empty casks - They put two barrels of ale down, I asked them what they were.</p>
               <p>Q. We will pass over the 4th of September, in consequence of what passed then; when did you see Blake again - A. On the 10th, Mr. Blew came, I informed him of the conversation we had had together; Mr.

            , Blew, and myself made an arrangement.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, did you see Blake again - A. On the 16th, he brought three barrels of amber in the regular way; a strange man, named Cox, came with him; besides the three barrels of amber, he brought three barrels of ale, which I had not ordered; he put the amber into the alecellar - I was with him; he said it was not convenient to put the ale there, he put them into the porter-cellar. Mr. Blew was secreted in the liquor-cellar, which was only boarded off, to hear what passed. He had marked six 1l. notes of mine. Mears and Friend, two officers, were in the parlour. I asked Blake what was the price of the three barrels which were in the porter-cellar? he said 6l. I asked him how the money was to be divided, saying,"there is just the money." I had in my pocket the same 6l. which Blew had marked - He put them into his pocket. He said, "We draymen all know of it, and we all share alike." I said, "You must get them out from home, without it being known," He said, "We all share alike." Blake then sent me up for some washing tubs, to rack the ale off into porter-butts. He said, there then could be no suspicion; and he never left any casks that he brought on his own account.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the 10th or 16th of September did you see the prisoner Fabb - A. Yes; he brought two barrels in the regular way; he opened the cellar flap, and said, "Ah, Charley was in a hurry when he was here a day or two ago," noticing the flap. I said "what Charley?" he said,"why Blake." I asked him what he meant, he said,"Oh, we all know of it - We all share alike." When he was going away he called me to the door, and said, do not you want some more ale such as Blake brought the other day? I said I had ordered a barrel or two in the regular way; he said that would be just the thing, and went away with the dray - I believe this was on the Saturday before Tuesday the 16th. I went very early to Wyatts' on the Monday morning, and ordered three barrels to come early on the next morning, which was the 16th.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had this conversation about the washing tubs, you fetched the officers down - A. Yes, and they took Blake into custody in the cellar-this was on the 16th of September.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. I have lived seven years in that house; I declined the offer that was made to me in April.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it a very wicked proposal - A. Certainly, and rejected it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell Messrs. Wyatt - A. Because I promised I would not. I advised them to do nothing of the kind again; and I thought they would not make me the offer afterwards. I told the clerk I thought every thing was not going on right in the Firm.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you went to Wyatt's when he proposed it to you again - A. I had no proof, and thought they would not believe me. I never told until the 4th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you always called Walkingshaw - A. I never went by any other name.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you never called Walkingham - A.It was put in the Times newspaper as Walkingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever at Portsmouth - A. I was working very hard there on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Q. What for - A. For setting fire to a field of furze for the sake of the after grass. I was convicted at the Assizes, and received seven years for it-my right name is

               <p>ABRAHAM HUDSON. I am store-clerk to the prosecutors, and have been so six months; the prisoners were their draymen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any application made to you for some ale for Walkingshaw on the 16th of September - A. Yes; three barrels of beer were to go by a regular order, and three barrels was to go to Greenwich; Blake and Collins were the men who drove that dray, but Collins being ill Cox went for him. - I delivered the barrels to Blake. I saw the dray go from the brewhouse with all that was regularly ordered. The key of the storehouse is kept in the counting-house. After Blake had gone out he brought the storehouse key back and hung it up. He told me the day before that he wanted some ale for Walkingshaw, that we might divide the profits among us four-meaning the three prisoners and myself. Six barrels were given out in the regular way-three for Walkingshaw and three to go to Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Q. If nine went out three must have gone wrongfully - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Before I lived with Messrs. Wyatt, I was in business for myself; before that I lived clerk with Mr. Cowell, in the Borough - I left there because he moved. I did not see Blake in the storehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. You stole the ale, and they sold it - A. Yes, and shared the profits; I was taken up, and turned evidence to save myself. The three prisoners, Collins, and myself, were to share the profits.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COX. I am drayman to Messrs. Wyatt - I went out with Blake, because Collins was ill; I never went out with him before; we took six barrels from Port-pool-lane, we then went to the storehouse in St. John's Mews with the dray, and found the prisoners, Fabb and Payne, there; they got three barrels out of the cellar, and put them on the dray, with the six which were brought from Portpool-lane-all assisted in putting them on. I did not know they were doing wrong. Blake and I went on with the nine barrels to Walkingshaw's, and delivered six barrels there. I do not know what passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. I never took out much beer. I was taken into custody myself, but liberated, and am still in the prosecutors' employ. This was the first day I came into their service, as one of the men was ill. The barrels were let down the flap.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HEMMINGS. I take care of horses opposite the storehouse. On the 16th of September I saw the three prisoners taking some beer out of the store-cellar, with Cox, who was a stranger to me; I knew the others before.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BLEW. I am collecting-clerk to the prosecutors. On the 10th of September I called at Walkingshaw's, from what he told me, it was agreed that I should be at his house on the 16th, with two officers, when some beer should be delivered; I got there about six o'clock in the morning, and marked six 1l. notes of his, and gave them to him; I secreted myself in the spirit-cellar, where I could hear all that passed. About eight o'clock Blake came down, the cellar-flap was opened, and three barrels let down at the ale-cellar-three had been ordered regularly-three were put into the porter-cellar, which were not ordered; they were the prosecutors, barrels, and contained store ale-Blake put them there. Walkingshaw told Blake that Fabb was with him on the Friday before, and delivered two barrels of ale to a regular order, and after putting them in the cellar, Fabb asked him if he wanted any in the irregular way, and said he could serve him as well as Blake, and asked him if he could? Blake said he could, for they were both in the business, or to that effect. He then asked him if the storehouse-clerk(Hudson), was in it, he said he was, and that he was a d-d good fellow, and would come and smoke a pipe with him some Sunday. Walkingshaw said he supposed it was the same price as the last, and that was 6l., and put the notes into Blake's hand, who said it was right-the regular price of three barrels of ale is 12l. The officers came down, took Blake, and found the six 1l. notes which I had marked, on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. If the store ale turns out bad, we sell it to the porter brewers. Hudson generally gave directions for the delivery of the ale, and sometimes Mr. Wyatt. The store ale was not fit for immediate use. I heard every thing that passed. The publicans do not give the draymen any thing for bringing ale. I never made Walkingshaw any offer to give evidence.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FRIEND. I am a constable. I was at Walkingshaw's, and took Blake. I tapped him on the shoulder; he immediately called to Cox for a tickler. I produced my staff, and told him there was one. I told him I wanted the six notes he had received from Walkingshaw. He hesitated, and at last said they were in his right-hand pocket. I took them out, and asked him if any other person was concerned with him? he said there was not, and it was a bad job and he must make the best of it.</p>

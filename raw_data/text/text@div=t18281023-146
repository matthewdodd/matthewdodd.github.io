            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and searched the prisoner; I found a brooch and a ring in his right-hand waistcoat pocket; three rings in the shopman's hat, which stood close to the prisoner on the counter, and this brooch and a pair of ear-rings were behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The young woman offered him some money for them, which he would not take; he got into a passion, and snatched the bowl away, and dropped some of them; the ring and brooch which were found on me I had got out of pawn that morning; he said at Bow-street he could not swear to them.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL WOOLF. I said I could not swear to any of them, for we have a number of articles all like these.</p>

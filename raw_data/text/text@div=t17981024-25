             sworn. - I am a constable of St. Ann's: About eleven o'clock at night I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vollam. I was present when the things were taken out of her boxes, they were searched in the prisoner's presence, in the back kitchen; there was a jar of vinegar and gherkins, and a clothes-brush, and two yards of black lace locked up in her box; it was impossible for me to miss these things out of about thirty or forty thousand articles; the property is most of it here; the soap was found upon the cistern.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240019"></xptr>Q. How do you know the prisoner at the bar stole that soap? - A. I believe either she or the man that was in bed with her did; I found a man in bed with her between eleven and twelve o'clock at night; the nutmegs were found upon the top of the bureau bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she put them there? - A. I do not know; it is impossible to swear to any articles in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the lace? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gruney. Q. This person who was with the prisoner, I believe, you had some acquaintance with? - A. He was an acquaintance of my wife's sister.</p>
               <p>Q. The only things found in the box were the brush and the lace, and the gherkins? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the only thing you have any mark upon is the brush? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you had never sold that brush? - A. Yes; I will swear I never sold one like that in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you had a gentleman a lodger? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear that she had not taken that brush to brush that gentleman's coat? - A. He had a man to brush his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. But will you swear that she never did? - A. I think I could.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence, but called one witness, who had known her seven years, and gave her a good character.</p>

I marked two half-sovereigns, handed them to Brannan, and he to Mrs. Gladwell—next evening, the 19th, I was in the street watching—I watched Gladwell come away from the shop—I met her, and spoke to her, and went in in a few minutes—I got in about five minutes before six—I saw the prisoner in the shop, and the boy and West—I went at once to the top ill, pulled it out, and there was silver and copper in it, but no gold—the prisoner was by my side at the time—I told him to go up to his tea—he had to pass by the desk in going up—the desk was always open—I took out what silver was in the till—I called in Brannan, I then un<lb></lb>locked the lower till—the gold could not get into that; it is not possible—the desk contains cards, and pieces of paper, and lists of prices, but no money—I saw the prisoner coming down stairs—I gave him in charge for stealing two marked half-sovereigns from the till—I do not know whether I made use of the word "marked"—he said, "If marked money is your plea, you will find none on me"—he was standing on the mat, which is at the foot of the stairs—he was taken into the counting-house, and searched—there was found on him 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver, wrapped up in pounds, and some coal and meat tickets—I examined the money, but could not find my half-sovereigns——the gold was wrapped in paper, as it would be for the purpose of being put into the till—I asked the prisoner how he came to have so much money about him—he said it was money he had received from his lodgers, and that he carried all his money about him—he said the boy Alfred had paid him a sovereign, and he had out it into the desk—he took Brannan to the desk—I found in a little hole these two half-sovereigns and one sovereign, wrapped up in a piece of brown paper, such as we use in the shop—the sovereigns that were in his pocket were in the same sort og paper—I have never known him or any one else to put money in the desk.</p>

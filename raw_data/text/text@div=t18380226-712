               <p>the 25th of February, I was in Farringdon-street—I was going across the road, and felt some one at my pocket—i turned, saw the prisoner, and laid hold of him—I intended to hold him till some one came to my assist<lb></lb>ance—he had his hand in my pocket—I had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he took two half-crowns, three penny pieces, and two halfpence—I took him, and should have held him, but some men came up, and attempted to strike me—I let him go, and they all ran up Bear-alley—there were three men came up to me—I ran after them, and called, "Stop thief"—my money was found—I saw it at the watch-house.</p>

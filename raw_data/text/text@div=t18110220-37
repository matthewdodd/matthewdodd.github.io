               <p>Q. In what state were the chests. - A. The lids were opened for shew. In consequence of information I watched the prisoner, towards the close of the day I observed him go into a room by himself, after the windows were shut, he staid there a minute or two, he returned towards me again, he went into the room again, the second time he staid there a short time, when he was coming towards me I perceived him rubbing his hands towards the waistband of his breeches, I then went to the Elder, and told him I had reason to believe he had tea about him, I made it known to Mr. Jones; the warehouse keeper. The bell was ringing, the prisoner was coming down stairs, I had Mr. Brooks with me, I called the prisoner of one side, he followed me into the store room, I said,</p>
               <p>"Churton, I have reason to believe you have some tea about you," he said, he had not, I began to unbutton the waistband of his breeches, there I saw this tea in this bag, the bag was tied to his waistband as a sob, and fastened behind, I took the tea out of the bag, this is the tea, there is twelve ounces of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there tea of this description in the warehouse where this man was working. - A. There was, Mr. Sannders asked the prisoner how long he had been at this work, he said no great while.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner been at work there. - A. About twenty years.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

I live at Stock, which is three miles on the other side of Billericay, and six from Chelmsford—I know Robert Wicker—his family live at Stock, very little distance from me—on Friday morning, the 4th of August, I remember his coming home to Stock—he came to me between two and three o'clock in the morning for the key of the door, which his mother had left with me, as she went out nursing—I put the key out of the window to him—I saw him next morning, and carried him some water for his breakfast, and I saw him all that day in Stock—he did not leave at all on Friday—he remained there nearly a fortnight—it was on the 4th of <hi rend="italic">July</hi>, that he came for the key—he was at home from the 4th of July till the 4th of August—it was about a month ago that he came to me for the key—I know it was the 4th of August—it was three weeks from this time, I believe.</p>

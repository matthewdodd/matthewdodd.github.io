            . I live in Clerkenwell. I was returning from work on Thursday night, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, and on going through <placeName id="t18200517-107-crimeloc629">St. John's-lane</placeName>

I had an umbrella up, and saw some men standing at the corner of George-court - I think there were four. When I came within a yard of them the two prisoners came out against me - it was just under a very strong gas-light; I am positive as to their two persons. Newman laid hold of the bottom of my waistcoat, and a the same instant. I felt my watch violently pulled, I put my hand down and laid hold of it - another pull was given, they broke the chain, and got part of it and the seals; they both ran away together. I immediately pursued, and got a head of Newman; he turned back. I rose a cry, and just as I came up with him Phenix passed before us - they were both taken immediately. When Newman was secured I heard something fall, and my chain and seals were picked up.</p>

On the 3d of November, I met the prisoner about eleven o'clock at night. I went to a house with her, but do not know where - we went to bed. I awoke at four o'clock in the morning, she was gone, and my watch and appendages. I had left it in my pocket - I slept in my clothes. My brother and cousin were with me, and came to the door to awake me. I found a pocket and some duplicates in the room, by which means I found her in bed, alone. I said I would give her two sovereigns to produce my watch - she said she knew nothing about it. My brother found it in the bed without the cases. She was quite intoxicated. I said if she would say where the cases were I would give her a sovereign - she would not and I called the officer.</p>

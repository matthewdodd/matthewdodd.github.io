The witness told me he had lost his watch; I saw the prisoner run, put the watch down at the step of a door, and then run on; I took her, and found the watch at the step of the door - the prosecutor said, "She has got the watch;" I said, "No - she has put it down."(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

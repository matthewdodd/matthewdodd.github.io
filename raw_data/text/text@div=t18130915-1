            . I am an officer. On the 27th of July I apprehended the prisoner at the Belvidere; she was servant there. The waiter shewed me the room where she slept. I took the prisoner and Mrs. Linfitt into her room. There was only one bed in the room; the prisoner said it was her room. Between the bed and the sacking I found a pair of blankets; they were claimed by Mr. Linfitt. I found a silk handkerchief and a cambric dress; they were in the room, but I cannot now say whether they were found in the box or on the bed, because the prisoner attempted to throw herself out of the window. I prevented her. It was the upper room, the four pair, I believe. I searched the room again the next day; the prosecutrix was there; I found several articles that she claimed. On Wednesday the 28th, I received the pocket-book of the prosecutor at the Bell inn, Noble-street, and one silver spoon. I went with the prosecutrix on Saturday, the 31st, I received this pair of sheets of Mr. Blunt at the office. The pawnbroker has the spoon; they are here.</p>
